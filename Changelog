### Pending tasks

  - Dictionaries: the word lists used to generate AIT passphrases and passwords needs to be integrated to this package.
    (and its taxonomy adapted as it differs to what has been standardises here)

  - Quotes: correct the buffer overrun in `df-y2k` bug (see file `french-bug.yaml` file)

  - Quotes: many redundant entries to zap. Take care when consolidating to keep tags.

  - Quotes: Rework quote files to systematically use the authors dataset (`authors.yaml`).

  - Quotes: Tags in `french.yaml` should be translated to English.

  - Quotes: establish a sorting scheme to dispatch quotes into files and determine the sorting order within each file. Current
    thinking is to sort quotes by author and split quotes into an abc√©daire of files based on the author's family names with
    predefined files for proverbs, unassigned quotes, and so on. Classification of quotes for a same author are arranged in a
    semi-sorted way:

      - quotes are primarily sorted by size, the shortest first
      - when known, sub-sorting by date is down, the newest appearing first
      - otherwise, approximate alphabetical sorting is done, in what could be called a _dictionary sort_ considering the first
        significant word in the quote.

  - Quotes: French quotes were primarily obtained from a unique source one or two decades ago without keeping track of the source.
    Some research needs to be done to give due credit.
