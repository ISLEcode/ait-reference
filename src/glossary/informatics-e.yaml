        **E-readers** are devices that facilitate screen-based reading of books and periodicals. These are devices for which
        reading is the sole purpose or among the leading uses. E-readers today primarily include black-and-white e-readers using
        e-ink technology; tablet devices, which offer color, allow access to rich media, and support enhanced e-book content as
        well as newspapers and magazines; and smartphones, such as the iPhone, and Android- and Windows-based phones.

        **E-Discovery software** facilitates the identification, collection, preservation, processing, review, analysis and
        production of electronically stored information (ESI) to meet the mandates imposed by common-law requirements for
        discovery. These demands may be due to civil or criminal litigation, regulatory oversight or administrative proceedings.
        The E-Discovery Reference Model (EDRM) maps traditional common-law discovery into a six-step, nine-process framework for
        technology.

        **E-learning** is the use of Internet technology for learning outside of the classroom. E-learning suites are software
        solutions that enable automation, administration and training over the Internet. E-learning suites are integrated product
        collections that comprise learning management systems (LMSs), virtual classrooms, courseware and learning content
        management systems (LCMSs). An LMS is software that automates the training process and function and includes registration
        and administration tools, skills and records management, courseware access, and programming interfaces to packaged
        applications. An LCMS is an integrated set of technology that manages all aspects of learning content. This includes
        authoring or acquisition, content history, auditing, replacement, and deletion. An LCMS generally works in conjunction
        with an LMS.

        **E-procurement** applications support indirect spending by giving casual users (i.e., employees who are not procurement
        professionals) a self-service solution for requisitioning and ordering goods and services. Although e-procurement
        solutions are geared toward indirect spending management by enabling individuals to initiate the requisition process and
        select purchases, they are occasionally configured for direct materials procurement, when plan-driven inventory
        replenishment isn't practical.

    desc : |-4
        An **earth station** is a collection of equipment installed on the earth's surface that enables communications over one or
        more satellites. Earth stations consist of a reflector antenna (or parabolic dish), a feed system to send and receive the
        RF carrier, data handling equipment and mechanical tracking equipment to keep the satellite within the antenna's data
        send/receive area. Earth stations are typically owned by the company receiving the data from the satellite network, thus
        must operate within certain specified parameters to maintain the network's stability. Earth stations are part of a
        satellite network's ground segment, which consists of all earth stations operating in a satellite system. These can be
        connected to the end user's equipment directly or via a terrestrial network.

    term : Elastic Multitenancy
    abbr :
    from : ITIL glossary (2013)
    desc : |-4
        With **elastic multitenancy** , application instances (tenants) are isolated logically, but integrated physically. The
        degree of logical isolation must be complete, but the degree of physical integration varies. The tenants can be
        organizations using one multitenant application or multiple applications competing for shared underlying resources.
        Multitenancy may also be nested when tenants are independent software vendors (ISVs) with their own subtenants.
        Multitenancy is elastic when resources are redistributed among tenants on-demand.

    desc : |-4
        **Electronic paper** refers to several reflective display technologies that do not require a backlight and can be viewed
        in conditions of good ambient illumination. Bistable pixels -- that remain in a particular state after the power is
        removed -- are used. For static images, this results in ultralow energy consumption. Most electronic paper technologies
        involve physical movement within the pixel to facilitate a change from light to dark, or to change color. The performance
        achieved has therefore been slower than with other displays, such as LCDs.

    desc : |-4
        **Electrovibration** is based on an effect in which touch receptors in the skin can be duped into perceiving texture.
        Electrical charges simulate the feeling of localized vibration and friction, mimicking shapes, textures and contours (such
        as the feel of a keyboard key or a button) on touchscreens on tablets and other mobile devices or product surfaces. No
        electrical charge passes through the skin as the charge is created through movement over a conductive surface. A periodic
        electrostatic force is created, which "deforms" the skin on the finger.

        **Embedded analytics** is the use of reporting and analytic capabilities in transactional business applications. These
        capabilities can reside outside the application, reusing the analytic infrastructure built by many enterprises, but must
        be easily accessible from inside the application, without forcing users to switch between systems. The integration of a
        business intelligence (BI) platform with the application architecture will enable users to choose where in the business
        process the analytics should be embedded.

    term : Enhanced Data Rates For Global Evolution (EDGE)
    abbr :
    from : ITIL glossary (2013)
    desc : |-4
        Part of the 3GPP set of standards and based on GSM and shared media packet data, **Enhanced Data Rates for Global
        Evolution (EDGE)** uses a different and more efficient modulation scheme: the eight-phase shift key (8-PSK), rather than
        the Gaussian minimum shift keying (GMSK) modulation scheme used over the radio interface by GSM and GPRS. This enhanced
        modulation technique opens up more bandwidth per radio carrier or cell. EDGE supports peak data rates of up to 384 kbps
        per cell, assuming that all eight time slots are used and that one time slot is not reserved for signaling. As with GPRS,
        bandwidth is shared by all concurrent users operating in the same cell. EDGE requires higher radio signal quality than
        that found in an average GSM network before higher data throughput speeds can be reached. EDGE also provides enhanced GRPS
        capabilities for data using 8-PSK, and when fully integrated with adaptive multirate (AMR), EDGE 2 also provides superior
        voice capacity to the GSM network.

        ERP tools share a common process and data model, covering broad and deep operational end-to-end processes, such as those
        found in finance, HR, distribution, manufacturing, service and the supply chain.

        ERP applications automate and support a range of administrative and operational business processes across multiple
        industries, including line of business, customer-facing, administrative and the asset management aspects of an enterprise.
        However, ERP deployments tend to come at a significant price, and the business benefits are difficult to justify and
        understand.

        Look for business benefits in four areas: IT cost savings, business process efficiency, as a business process platform for
        process standardization and as a catalyst for business innovation. Most enterprises focus on the first two areas, because
        they are the easiest to quantify; however, the latter two areas often have the most significant impact on the enterprise.

        task is to tightly integrate the server-based communications products and application functionality into a UC
        infrastructure. This domain is the key battlefield for infrastructure vendors with leadership aspirations in UC.

        This domain emerges as a result of convergence in the established separate markets for telephony PBXs, e-mail and
        calendaring, voice mail, audioconferencing, Web conferencing and the more recent market for IM. It also encompasses some
