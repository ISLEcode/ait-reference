    desc : |-4
        Data communications network in which data is divided into small segments known as packets. These are divided so that each
        packet forms part of a complete message that can be routed through a network of switches to its destination independently
        of all other packets forming the same message.

    desc : |-4
        A technique in which a message is broken into smaller units called packets, which may be individually addressed and routed
        through the network, possibly using several different routes. The receiving-end node ascertains that all packets are
        received and in the proper sequence before forwarding the complete message to the addressee.

    term : Page
    abbr :
    from : ITIL glossary (2013)
    desc : |-4
        An output device that prints one page at a time. This includes the following types of device:

        -   Laser -- An electrophotographic technology in which laser beams are used to transfer images to a photoreceptor belt or
            a drum. It has the ability to buffer, in part or in whole, a page of images received from an electronic source and
            then transfer these images to a receiving substrate.

        -   Light-emitting diode (LED) -- An electrophotographic technology in which precisely aligned arrays of LEDs are used to
            expose the print drum. Oc√© employs a unique and proprietary variation on electrophotography that it calls CopyPress.
            The technology is similar and uses a solid toner. The image is built up color by color and then deposited on an
            intermediate drum, just as is done in some color laser printers. The difference is that CopyPress can print seven
            toners for a wide color gamut. The toner is then pressed into the paper and fused at a lower temperature than on laser
            printers.

        -   Liquid electrophotography (LEP) -- A technology in which the toner is a liquid and is absorbed into the paper fibers
            instead of adhering to the surface the way laser print does. As a result, the printed pages look and feel
            offset-printed. As on printing presses, the different colored inks are deposited on a rubber roller called a blanket
            and are then transferred to the paper. This means the inks mix as they soak into the surface of the paper rather than
            being layered on top of one another, as is the case with laser printers. With up to six inks, LEP printers can also
            produce a wider range of colors than the four colors usually found in dry-toner laser printers.

        -   Solid ink -- An inkjet technology in which solid inks are liquefied by heating and then sprayed onto a drum, where
            they are then transferred to paper. Solid inkjet can print on a wide range of paper types because the solid ink does
            not wick into paper to degrade the image. Solid ink printers and MFPs are included in the page printer market because
            they compete directly with the laser output devices.

        -   Electron beam, imaging ion deposition and magnetography -- Examples of other technologies that can be used in page
            output devices..

    term : Parabolic Trough
    abbr :
    from : ITIL glossary (2013)
    desc : |-4
        A **parabolic trough** is a type of concentrated solar power (CSP) system. Long, curved mirrors arranged in a line
        concentrate sunlight on pipes located at the mirrors' focal center. These pipes run down the length of the trough and
        contain an oil that is heated by the concentrated sunlight. This oil flows through the pipes to a power plant, where it
        boils water. The resulting steam produces electricity in a conventional steam generator. During the course of the day, a
        motor rotates the mirrors to track the position of the sun. To limit intermittency and improve dispatch capability, these
        systems may have molten salt storage or a co-firing natural gas system.

    abbr :
    from : ITIL glossary (2013)
    desc : |-4
        **Parallel Network File System (pNFS)** is an emerging industry standard for parallel storage input/output (I/O), which is
        an optional feature of Network File System (NFS) v.4.1. The new technology requires a pNFS client and a pNFS server. The
        pNFS server manages file metadata and communicates a file layout map to the client, and the client performs direct storage
        I/O based on the layout. The storage access protocol can be based on files, blocks or objects.

    term : Parallel Processing
    abbr :
    from : ITIL glossary (2013)
    desc : |-4
        The solution of a single problem across more than one processor. Little parallel processing is done today outside of
        research laboratories, because it is difficult to decompose tasks into independent parts, and the compiler technology does
        not yet exist that will extensively parallelize applications code.

    term : Partitioning Code
    abbr :
    from : ITIL glossary (2013)
    desc : |-4
        Applications can be broken into three logical parts -- presentation, logic and data. These are areas in which the program
        can be separated to facilitate execution of each logical piece on a different machine. Each segment is known as a
        partition. For example, the thin-client Web model requires that interface presentation be handled by the browser,
        application logic by the Web server and other application servers, and data by a database server. Developers are
        responsible for determining where the separation occurs.

    term : Pattern-Based Strategy
    abbr :
    from : ITIL glossary (2013)
    desc : |-4
        Gartner defines **Pattern-Based Strategy** as the discipline that enables business leaders to seek, amplify, examine and
        exploit new business patterns. A business pattern is a set of recurring and/or related elements (business activities,
        events, weak or strong signals) that indicates a business opportunity or threat. A weak or strong signal is a piece of
        information, an activity, and/or an event that indicates an impending change that might have an impact on your business
        pattern. The term "business pattern framework" refers to an organization's focus on and its investment in a balanced
        diversity of business activities (in the defined, creative, collective and exceptions categories) that enable it to lead
        and respond to weak and strong signals of change (opportunity or threat). The aim of business pattern recognition is to
        understand how elements (activities, events, objects and information) may form new patterns that represent an opportunity
        for innovation or a threat of disruption to business operations or strategy.

    desc : |-4
        PDM technologies and products have historically been positioned as the primary application backbone for managing and
        controlling the flow of design intent across the three major design stages: concept design, detail design and production.
        But in practice, PDM has served as a complementary application tower to computer-aided design (CAD) and enterprise
        resource planning (ERP) systems by providing the main repository for production-approved engineering data (i.e., vaulting)
        and managing the changes to production - approved data (e.g., engineering change orders and configuration management). PDM
        is a key enabler for constructing a concurrent art-to-product environment (CAPE) for enterprisewide design and production.
        A well-constructed PDM enables all participants involved with the capture, communication and maintenance of design intent
        to freely share and disseminate all heterogeneous data related to the product. PDM evolved from the need to better manage
        paper, electronic documents, engineering change orders, and bills of materials during the product development process.

        **Penetration testing** goes beyond vulnerability scanning to use multistep and multivector attack scenarios that first
        find vulnerabilities and then attempt to exploit them to move deeper into the enterprise infrastructure. Since this is how
        advanced targeted attacks work, penetration testing provides visibility into aggregations of misconfigurations or
        vulnerabilities that could lead to an attack that could cause serious business impact. As a minimum, penetration testing
        provides a means for prioritizing the highest risk vulnerabilities.

        The concept of a **performance-driven culture** is a change in management style that shifts from a "rearview-mirror
        perspective" focused on financial measures to a perspective that balances this with the use of leading performance
        indicators and weak signals to actively seek and then act on patterns to drive better business outcomes. This approach
        will fundamentally change strategic-planning processes and the execution of strategies. Successful organizations will
        create a performance-driven culture in which business strategies will change with the emergence of new business patterns,
        which will drive changes in the operational behaviors of managers and employees.

        **Plain Old XML (POX)** refers to techniques where applications exchange raw XML documents using standard transfer
        protocols, such as HTTP, Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) and File Transfer Protocol (FTP), or using proprietary
        protocols (such as message-oriented middleware). "Raw" means that XML documents aren't wrapped in any kind of messaging
        protocol or envelope, such as SOAP or AtomPub. Instead, POX relies on packaging capabilities of the transfer protocol and
        out-of-band agreements to supply infrastructure information and all metadata about payload formats and service interface
        descriptions. Those trade-offs aside, POX supports exceptional interoperability. It provides significantly less
        infrastructure functionality than other XML messaging systems, such as a message envelope, and, therefore, imposes
        additional burdens on applications to perform infrastructure functionality.

        **Predictive modeling** is a commonly used statistical technique to predict future behavior. Predictive modeling solutions
        are a form of data-mining technology that works by analyzing historical and current data and generating a model to help
        predict future outcomes. In predictive modeling, data is collected, a statistical model is formulated, predictions are
        made, and the model is validated (or revised) as additional data becomes available. For example, risk models can be
        created to combine member information in complex ways with demographic and lifestyle information from external sources to
        improve underwriting accuracy. Predictive models analyze past performance to assess how likely a customer is to exhibit a
        specific behavior in the future. This category also encompasses models that seek out subtle data patterns to answer
        questions about customer performance, such as fraud detection models. Predictive models often perform calculations during
        live transactions--for example, to evaluate the risk or opportunity of a given customer or transaction to guide a
        decision. If health insurers could accurately predict secular trends (for example, utilization), premiums would be set

        A **procurement network** is a type of business process network: integration as a service tailored with applications to
        support one or more procurement processes, such as: Purchase to pay, with e-catalog management and purchase order document
        exchange Supplier information management, with credential document and firmographic data storage E-sourcing, with
        opportunity listings for suppliers and support for supplier electronic bid submission The defining characteristic of a
        procurement network is multienterprise integration support that enables suppliers to view information from and participate
        in processes with multiple buyers, in the same account.

        **Product analytics** is a specialized application of business intelligence (BI) and analytical software that consumes
        service reports, product returns, warranties, customer feedback and data from embedded sensors to help manufacturers
        evaluate product defects, identify opportunities for product improvements, detect patterns in usage or capacity of
        products, and link all these factors to customers. Product analytics can also incorporate feeds from social platforms to
        track complaints about products. By analyzing product data feeds in real time, this software can proactively alert
        manufacturers to service and replacement needs in reactive as well as preventive maintenance scenarios, and help route
        service requests to the proper individuals or, with the help of machine-to-machine (M2M) technologies, perform service
        remotely.

        **Product portfolio and program management (PPM)** is the continuous cultivation of a product set and the set of
        capabilities to prioritize and manage product development programs. Software that supports portfolio management assists in
        analyzing and reporting risks versus opportunities, and it makes these analyses and opinions visible to all decision
        makers. PPM includes dashboards with executive views of decision variables, such as risk, opportunity, resource
        allocation, investments, product-revenue performance and customer acceptance. For decision-making teams, this visibility
        makes the selection of product investments more objective. It also helps manufacturers to systematically allocate
        resources for product life cycle support. This category also includes project/program management capabilities to monitor
        the progress of product development programs and make adjustments when teams encounter bottlenecks or other difficulties.

        Product support services refer to labor-based services for hardware or software, which can be performed by the
        manufacturer of the product or parties other than the vendor that created the product. These services can be provided by
        several types of vendors, typically including hardware OEMs, such as Dell, HP, EMC or IBM; and software publishers, such
        as Microsoft, Oracle or SAP. Formal channel partners of hardware and software vendors also provide support services.

        Product support services are also delivered by additional independent service providers and third-party support providers.
        An independent service provider delivers a broad range of services for hardware and/or software products (such as
        consulting or support), and may have an alliance with the product manufacturer but not as a primary means to its service
        business. A third-party support provider primarily delivers break/fix technical support for hardware and/or software
        products and is not typically aligned with the product manufacturer but may have a relationship in certain specific
        exceptional cases.

        Production devices encompass printers, stand-alone copiers and MFPs featuring a printing speed of more than 70 ppm in both
        monochrome and color. Production printers perform three specific types of printing:

        -   Transaction printing includes statements, bills, notices and other transactional documents that are printed in large
            volumes. With the growth of color print, transaction printing is merging into direct marketing with promotional and
            marketing pieces with the inclusion of personalized color items as well. "Transpromo" refers to transactional
            documents that have a promotional message or third-party advertising on them.

        -   Direct marketing, such as direct-mail packages.

        -   Publishing that includes short-run printing, print on demand (POD) booklets, catalogs, manuals and brochures, which
            are printed on an as-needed basis. POD is also being used to print books that are published in limited volumes.

    desc : |-4
        A **project management office (PMO)** is usually created to solve a specific problem: generally, the IT organization's
        inability to deliver IT projects on time, on budget and in scope. Project managers may "live" in the PMO, or in different
        IT units, such as in application development or in the business.

        Almost all PMOs start at this initial project management stage before they can evolve to the program management or
        portfolio management stages.

        The scope of work changes from tactical to strategic, while the scope of initiatives broadens from IT-intensive projects
        to enterprise-wide business and IT initiatives. Once the PMO has earned credibility with the business, it usually receives
        requests to help manage business projects.

        **Project management** is the application of knowledge, skills, tools and techniques to project activities to meet the
        project requirements.

        Gartner analysts observe many clients focused on enhancing the collaboration, communication and resulting project
        portfolio-level reporting needed to gain first-line visibility into project demand, project status, resource capacity and
        utilization, and cost estimates versus actuals.

        PPM leaders recognize that the primary value of projects goes beyond delivering on-time and on-budget projects, and rather
        ensures the expected business outcomes and realized value. Further, they are increasingly aware that the biggest changes
        from project activities are actually people-oriented, and that they influence culture and mind-sets across the enterprise.

        Successful project management is characterized by the ongoing development and refinement of methods and practices and
        ensuring that any software tools deployed meet the needs without becoming a burden.

        much easier to transmit these programs. While many commercial software developers have developed software that has become
        the de facto standard (e.g., Microsoft's Windows programs), proprietary software that is based on proprietary protocols,
        or standards, can create obstacles for application development and usage.

        ASCII to BSC), allowing that end-user device to communicate with another device (e.g., a computer) with which it would
        otherwise be incompatible. Protocol conversion can be performed by a dedicated device (a protocol converter); by a
        software package loaded onto an existing system, such as a general-purpose computer, front-end processor, or private
        branch exchange (PBX) system; or by a value-added network, such as Telenet.

        Gartner defines **public cloud computing** as a style of computing where scalable and elastic IT-enabled capabilities are
        provided as a service to external customers using Internet technologies--i.e., public cloud computing uses cloud computing
        technologies to support customers that are external to the provider's organization. Using public cloud services generates
        the types of economies of scale and sharing of resources that can reduce costs and increase choices of technologies.From a
        government organization's perspective, using public cloud services implies that any organization (in any industry sector
        and jurisdiction) can use the same services (e.g., infrastructure, platform or software), without guarantees about where
        data would be located and stored.

        An encryption technique developed to overcome the limitations of secret-key cryptography (see separate entry). Public key
        (also called "asymmetric key") cryptography uses two mathematically related keys: A public key to encrypt messages, and a
        private key to decrypt them. In a public-key system, you communicate privately by encrypting your message using the public
        key of your intended recipient. Although everyone else knows the recipient's public key, it is useless for decrypting a
        message encrypted with it. Only the corresponding private key, known only to the recipient, can decrypt the message.

        **Public-key infrastructure (PKI)** was developed mainly to support secure information exchanges over unsecure networks.
        It has been used to ensure that the person identified as sending a transaction is the originator, that the person
        receiving the transaction is the intended recipient and that the transaction data has not been compromised. PKI requires a
        system for generating and managing digital certificates that identify the holders (people, systems or devices) of assigned
        public and private key pairs, which is useful for identification, authentication, encryption and digital signing.
        Enterprise PKI refers to the use of this system over enterprise intranets, and involves the issuance of digital
        certificates to individual users, servers and services, and software tools that assist with enrollment, integration with
        directory services, managing keys, and renewal and revocation of certificates.

        A communication pattern in which information sources "publish" (i.e., send) information to a somewhat intelligent
        middleware infrastructure, and information consumers "subscribe" by specifying what kind of information they want to
        receive from the infrastructure. The middleware must be able to physically transport messages from one or more publishers
        to one or more subscribers. It also must be smart enough to find the proper destinations by matching each message to
        subscription criteria. This model naturally supports one-to-many or many-to-many communication -- in contrast to either
        message passing or message queuing, both of which mostly (but not entirely) aim at one-to-one communication.
