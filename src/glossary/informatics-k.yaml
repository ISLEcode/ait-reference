    term : Ka-band (Kurtz-above Band)
    abbr :
    from : ITIL glossary (2013)
    desc : |-4
        Frequency range allocated from 17.7GHz on the downlink and to 30.6GHz on the uplink for use by satellite communication
        systems. Ka-band satellites deliver high-speed broadband Internet connectivity and digital video/audio transmission.
        Satellites in this frequency range are characterized by two-way or bidirectional communications capability;
        wider-bandwidth transponders that provide higher overall capacity spot beams that can direct or focus signal transmissions
        to areas of higher density/population; and more-efficient use of available spectrum through multiple reuse of the same
        frequency. Ka-band satellites can be implemented as GEO- and non-GEO satellite systems. See also Kurtz-under band
        (Ku-band), L-band and S-band.

    term : Kerfless Wafering
    abbr :
    from : ITIL glossary (2013)
    desc : |-4
        **Kerfless wafering** is a manufacturing process that produces very thin wafers of silicon from a crystal ingot with
        minimal waste material. Conventional wafering uses a wire saw to cut the ingot into wafers, and the material removed by
        the cutting blade, known as kerf, is lost as waste. The two main kerfless-wafering approaches being pursued are an implant
        and cleave process and a stress liftoff method. Implant and cleave is a two-step process that implants ions into
        crystalline silicon (c-Si) to form a subsurface cleave layer that is propagated through the crystal lattice to enable a
        very thin wafer to be removed. Stress liftoff is a technique that separates the silicon via induced stress at the
        interface of silicon and a deposited thin film.

    desc : |-4
        A **key performance indicator (KPI)** is a high-level measure of system output, traffic or other usage, simplified for
        gathering and review on a weekly, monthly or quarterly basis. Typical examples are bandwidth availability, transactions
        per second and calls per user. KPIs are often combined with cost measures (e.g., cost per transaction or cost per user) to
        build key system operating metrics.
