    term : QA (quality Assurance)
    abbr :
    from : ITIL glossary (2013)
    desc : |-4
        The historic focus of the National Committee on Quality Assurance (NCQA), fundamentally based on measures of compliance to
        standards or processes.

    term : QAM (quadrature Amplitude Modulation)
    abbr :
    from : ITIL glossary (2013)
    desc : |-4
        A combination of amplitude and phase modulation (and shift-keying) techniques used to transmit 9,600 bits per second (bps)
        over a 2,400-baud line.

    term : QoS (quality Of Service)
    abbr :
    from : ITIL glossary (2013)
    desc : |-4
        A negotiated contract between a user and a network provider that renders some degree of reliable capacity in the shared
        network.

    term : Quad-band
    abbr :

    desc : |-4
        Mobile device that supports voice and data communications conforming to one bearer technology, such as GSM, but on four
        different sets of frequencies. For example, many European and Asia/Pacific countries/markets have licensed deployment of
        GSM networks on 900MHz and 1,800MHz spectrums, and in North America GSM has been deployed on 800MHz and 1,900MHz. A
        quad-band phone allows the user to roam automatically among networks on any of these frequencies in any of these
        countries, providing that the "home" operator has roaming agreements with local mobile network operators. See also
        dual-band, dual-mode and tri-band.

    term : Quality Of Storage Service
    abbr :

    desc : |-4
        **Quality of storage service** optimizes the use of disk storage system resources via user-defined policies and/or
        adaptive algorithms that manage performance and throughput, while minimizing back-end storage costs. Quality of storage
        service includes a variety of technologies, including cache partitioning and binding, input/output (I/O) prioritization,
        and the automated movement of files, logical volumes or sub-volumes, or LUNs (aka auto-tiering) between cache, solid-state
        drives (SSDs), high-performance and high-capacity disks and other media (such as cloud or tape), as performance needs
        dictate and security requirements allow.

    term : Quantum Computer
    abbr :
    from : ITIL glossary (2013)
    desc : |-4
        A **quantum computer** uses atomic quantum states to effect computation. Data is held in qubits (quantum bits), which have
        the ability to hold all possible states simultaneously. This property, known as "superposition," gives quantum computers
        the ability to operate exponentially faster than conventional computers as word length is increased. Data held in qubits
        is affected by data held in other qubits, even when physically separated. This effect is known as "entanglement."
        Achieving both superposition and entanglement is extremely challenging.

    abbr :
    from : ITIL glossary (2013)
    desc : |-4
        **Quantum dots** are nanocrystals made from types of semiconductors that emit colored light. They are very small, with a
        diameter ranging from two to 10 nanometers. The different colors emitted can be finely tuned by changing the size of the
        quantum dot and manipulating their chemical composition.

    term : Quick Response Codes (QR Codes)
    abbr :
    from : ITIL glossary (2013)
    desc : |-4
        **Quick response codes (QR codes)** and color codes are high-density, two-dimensional bar codes that are readable by
        mobile phones and computer cameras with the correct software. Color codes enable the same physical space to encode more
        information by incorporating color in any pattern or shape, such as a logo, that attracts attention. Users capture the
        mono or color image, which, after decoding by the device, launches its browser, linking the device to the URL embedded in
        the code.QR codes may be printed on any substrate. The small, densely packed bar code fits well on printed transaction
        documents, magazines and direct-mail pieces, as well as clothing, point-of-purchase displays, packaging, buses, buildings
        and business cards. Software that captures QR codes tends to be very efficient and reliable (although users or specific
        apps report widely varying ease of use and results) and can capture any code in view of the camera, often when it is
        slightly out of focus or if only part of it is visible. Although the QR code enables the user to link to a URL, the
        website owner must still provide relevant product information, payment portal, and other content.
