    term : ICD-10 Adoption Technology
    abbr :
    from : ITIL glossary (2013)
    desc : |-4
        The **International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10)** is the newest version of the common tool used to
        turn diagnoses and procedures into a universally recognized machine-readable sequence. It replaces the decades-old ICD-9
        code standard. It has greater complexity, because it identifies twice as many diagnostic codes as ICD-9, 20 times as many
        injuries and 50 times as many procedures. Moreover, ICD-10 allows for alphanumeric codes and modernizes the fundamental
        structure for code assignment now and in future releases. ICD-10 is used almost exclusively in the U.S., although its use
        will not become mandatory until 1 October 2013. Implementation of the U.S. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability
        Act (HIPAA) X12, version 5010 standard is a prerequisite for using ICD-10. This standard will become mandatory on 1
        January 2012.Implementation of HIPAA 5010 is largely a technical electronic data interchange similar to a version control
        of an application. ICD-10 is much more complex because it changes IT and business operation attributes. Correctly
        implemented, it will increase coding accuracy and improve the care management, reimbursement and rating processes. In the
        short term, however, it is expensive and difficult to implement because of the many processes and applications affected by
        coding changes. It will also cut claims-processing auto-adjudication rates.

    term : Identity And Access Management (IAM)
    abbr :
    from : ITIL glossary (2013)
    desc : |-4
        **Identity and access management (IAM)** is the security discipline that enables the right individuals to access the right
        resources at the right times for the right reasons.

        IAM addresses the mission-critical need to ensure appropriate access to resources across increasingly heterogeneous
        technology environments, and to meet increasingly rigorous compliance requirements. This security practice is a crucial
        undertaking for any enterprise. It is increasingly business-aligned, and it requires business skills, not just technical
        expertise.

        Enterprises that develop mature IAM capabilities can reduce their identity management costs and, more importantly, become
        significantly more agile in supporting new business initiatives.

    term : Identity-Proofing Services
    abbr :
    from : ITIL glossary (2013)
    desc : |-4
        **Identity-proofing services** , which verify people's identities before the enterprise issues them accounts and
        credentials, are based on "life history" or transaction information aggregated from public and proprietary data sources.
        These services are also used as an additional interactive user authentication method, especially for risky transactions,
        such as accessing sensitive confidential information or transferring funds to external accounts. Identity-proofing
        services are typically used when accounts are provisioned over the Web or in a call center. However, they can also be used
        in face-to-face interactions.

    term : Image Recognition
    abbr :
    from : ITIL glossary (2013)
    desc : |-4
        **Image recognition** technologies strive to identify objects, people, buildings, places, logos, and anything else that
        has value to consumers and enterprises. Smartphones and tablets equipped with cameras have pushed this technology from
        mainly industrial applications (for example, sorting fruit) to consumer applications. For example, logos, cars, landmarks,
        wine labels, and book and album covers can be identified by consumer smartphones, using a mobile app that accesses image
        recognition software in the cloud. Image recognition has the potential to transform a picture into a hyperlink to
        something on the Internet (for example, information, service, coupon or video).It can also be used to initiate a
        search--which is one of the main reasons why Google and Amazon have been investing in this technology. In addition, image
        recognition has applications in security and content management. Our definition of image recognition does not include
        video analytics or video search, although video analysis frequently incorporates image recognition technologies.

        With the advent of high-density servers, infrastructure and operations (I&O) leaders are challenged to provide adequate
        cooling for computer rooms. **In-row** solutions provide highly focused cooling by placing multiple cooling units directly
        in a row of server racks or above the cold aisles (by having more than one per row, you gain redundancy and better
        placement of cold air to the heat source). These in-row systems may be used to augment the room cooling, or it may be a
        closed-loop system, built in a special cold-aisle enclosure for the racks that doesn't depend on room cooling. These
        systems can require chilled water or refrigerant to be piped directly to the rows of servers where the cooling units are

        information access with search

        Information access technologies interact with applications such as document management, Web content management and other
        repositories to provide users with insight into their content. Increasingly, information access technology is also
        expected to include results from enterprise applications, such as CRM and legacy systems. In addition, it looks outside
        enterprises to access Internet-based content. Information access technology is often acquired as an embedded aspect of
        other applications, and portal, ECM, business application and other vendors frequently include enterprise search as part
        of their products.

        The first and most mature information access technology is search engine technology. It is typically applied to
        unstructured data in document repositories. It includes both enterprise and desktop search. Increasingly, automatic
        categorization, creative visualization, content analytics and taxonomy support technologies are being added to this
        category.

        Reporting -- Reporting provides the ability to create formatted and interactive reports, with highly scalable distribution
        and scheduling capabilities. In addition, BI platform vendors should handle a wide array of reporting styles (for example,
        financial, operational and performance dashboards).

        Dashboards -- This subset of reporting includes the ability to publish formal, Web-based reports, with intuitive displays
        of information, including dials, gauges and traffic lights. These displays indicate the state of the performance metric
        compared with a goal or target value. Increasingly, dashboards are used to disseminate real-time data from operational
        applications.

        Ad hoc query -- This capability, also known as self-service reporting, enables users to ask their own questions of the
        data, without relying on IT to create a report. In particular, the tools must have a robust semantic layer to allow users
        to navigate available data sources. In addition, these tools should offer query governance and auditing capabilities to
        ensure that queries perform well.

        Microsoft Office integration -- In some cases, BI platforms are used as a middle tier to manage, secure and execute BI
        tasks, but Microsoft Office (particularly Excel) acts as the BI client. In these cases, it is vital that the BI vendor
        provides integration with Microsoft Office, including support for document formats, formulas, data "refresh" and pivot
        tables. Advanced integration includes cell locking and write-back.

        single location does not provide usable information. Only the originator or a user with a list of the latest pointers with
        the original dispersal algorithm can properly assemble the complete information. This has been expanded to include
        peer-to-peer (P2P) file-sharing technologies and protocols, such as those based on the BitTorrent Protocol, which has
        proved to be robust on the Internet.

        This segment includes AD and application integration and middleware (AIM) software, information management software,
        storage management software, IT operations management and security software, and other infrastructure software.

        -   Application development and AIM software services -- The AD software market comprises tools that represent each phase
            of the software development life cycle (application life cycle management \[ALM\], design, construction, automated
            software quality and other AD software). The Application Infrastructure and Middleware market segment includes
            business process management (BPM)-enabling technologies, integration-enabling middleware, platform middleware, portals
            and Web 2.0 infrastructure, and various additional products grouped together as "other AIM." Integration-enabling
            middleware is software that enables independently designed applications, software components or services to work
            together, by supporting data consistency, composite application and multi-step process styles of integration.

        -   Information management software services -- This software market is defined by Data Management and Integration
            software and includes Data Integration Tools, Data Quality Tools and Database Management Systems. The discipline of
            data integration comprises the practices, architectural techniques and tools for achieving the consistent access and
            delivery of data across the spectrum of data subject areas and data structure types in the enterprise to meet the data
            consumption requirements of all applications and business processes. Traditionally aligned with cleansing of customer
            data (names and addresses) in support of CRM-related activities, the tools have expanded well beyond such
            capabilities, and forward-thinking organizations are recognizing the relevance of these tools in other data domains. A
            database management system (DBMS) is a product used for the storage and organization of data that typically has
            defined formats and structures. DBMSs are categorized by their basic structures and, to some extent, by their use or
            deployment.

        -   Storage management software services -- The storage management software market includes all software products that are
            sold as value-added options to run on a server, storage network device or storage device to aid in managing the device
            or managing and protecting the data. Storage management software represents all the tools needed to manage capacity,
            performance and availability of data stored on disks, tapes and optical devices, as well as the networking devices
            that the data may pass through.

        -   IT operations management and security software services -- IT operations management (ITOM) software is intended to
            represent all the tools needed to manage the provisioning, capacity, performance and availability of the computing,
            networking and application environment. Security software is included to control and monitor access to internal and
            external IT resources.

        -   Other infrastructure software services -- Other infrastructure software includes, but is not limited to, clustering
            and remote control software, directory servers, OS tools, Java license fees, mainframe infrastructure, and mobile and
            wireless infrastructure, as well as other infrastructure software.

        -   Operating system software -- An OS is software that, after being loaded into the computer by an initial boot program,
            manages a computer's resources, controlling the flow of information into and from a main processor. OSs perform
            complex tasks, such as memory management, control of displays and other input/output peripheral devices, networking
            and file management, and other resource allocation functions between software and system components. The OS provides
            the foundation on which applications, middleware and other infrastructure components function. OS usually provides
            user interfaces, such as command-line shell and GUI, for interaction between user and computer. The four most common
            subcategories of operating systems include Linux, Unix, Windows and mainframe OS..
