    desc : |-4
        **C-band** refers to the portion of the electromagnetic spectrum allotted for satellite transmissions in the 4GHz to 8GHz
        frequency range. C-band satellite antennas are used frequently in areas of the world where signals can become degraded due
        to heavy rain or other intense climate-related conditions. As a rule, C-band satellite antennas range in size from 1.8
        meters to 2.4 meters. C-band satellite communications suffer less from rain attenuation, but they require larger antennas
        and typically are used in Asia, Africa and Latin America. See also antenna, frequency bands, Ka-band, Ku-band and
        satellite dish.

        **C++** is an extension to the C language defined by Bjarne Stroustrop at Bell Laboratories in 1986. As a superset of C,
        it provides additional features for data abstraction and object-oriented programming. C++ can be used to develop programs
        for almost all computers. Together, C and C++ are the among the most common programming languages in use today.

    desc : |-4
        A **cache** is defined as a temporary storage area for instructions and data near a computer's central processing unit
        (CPU), usually implemented in high-speed memory. It replicates information from main memory or storage in a way that
        facilitates quicker access, using fewer resources than the original source. Because data is closer to the CPU, it can be
        retrieved more quickly.

    desc : |-4
        A **caching server** is a device that efficiently stores frequently requested data from protocols such as Hypertext
        Transport Protocol (HTTP) and File Transfer Protocol (FTP) and has the ability to "prefetch" additional data at preset
        intervals. A network caching server has the ability to listen on the network and intercept protocol requests on its
        associated Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) ports. This alleviates the need to have the enterprise's browser configured
        to "know" where the server sits on the network.

    desc : |-4
        A **call center** is a group or department in which employees receive and make high volumes of telephone calls. Call
        centers can have internal customers (e.g., help desks) or external customers (e.g., customer service and support centers).
        The call center uses a variety of technologies to improve the management and servicing of the call. A center that use both
        phone- and non-phone-based communication channels (e.g., e-mail or the Web) is known as a contact center.

    term : Call Detail Recording (CDR)
    abbr :
    from : ITIL glossary (2013)
    desc : |-4
        **Call detail recording (CDR)** is a means of capturing telephone system information on calls made, including who made the
        call, where it went and what time of day it was made, for processing into meaningful management reports. With such
        information, it is easier to spot exceptions to regular calling patterns such as out-of-hours calling, international
        calls, significant variances from previous reporting periods and call destinations that do not reflect normal calling
        patterns for the enterprise. Also known as station message detail recording (SMDR).

    term : Caller ID
    abbr :
    from : ITIL glossary (2013)
    desc : |-4
        **Caller ID** is a telephone service that records the telephone numbers of incoming calls; it is a form of automatic
        number identification (ANI). Caller ID systems can be integrated with customer databases to streamline call management
        processes. This integration gives the agent receiving a call instantaneous access to relevant information about the
        caller. For example, when a customer calls, that customer's name immediately appears on the agent's computer screen. The
        screen might include information about the product a customer purchased and the purchase date. The system could also
        display the client's previous call history, information about other products the customer owns and price promotions on
        products that might also be appealing to that caller, based on a profile in the database.

    abbr :
    from : ITIL glossary (2013)
    desc : |-4
        **Capable to promise (CTP) systems** enable enterprises to commit to customer orders based on production/resource capacity
        (available or planned) and inventory (available or planned). CTP solutions consider resource (equipment, people and
        materials) availability, capacities, constraints, work in progress or planned work, multiple steps in the production
        process, multiple nodes in a supply chain network (including, in some sophisticated use cases, supplier networks) and
        various rules to calculate accurate promises. Newer systems also consider non-production-related constraints, such as
        transportation, which enable delivery factors (such as shipping mode options) to be factored into promise dates.

    abbr :
    from : ITIL glossary (2013)
    desc : |-4
        CM software includes both stand-alone products and suites of products that can initially provision/configure desktops,
        servers or mobile devices, and then manage the change of configuration settings, software, and increasingly the files and
        data on those elements on an ongoing basis. Included in this category are stand-alone products for software distribution,
        various discovery requirements, remote control, software packaging, personality migration, software usage metering and
        mobile device management. Also included here are product suites that lead with provisioning and CM but may include
        features such as asset discovery, automated backup, bare-metal boot, self-healing functionality, data synchronization,
        security, virtualization -- both application and hosted virtual desktops (HVD) -- or even help desk features. When these
        features are sold as stand-alone products, revenue is counted in other categories. There are many tools that offer one or
        more of the functions above, and these are included as well. Some solutions for servers, for instance, offer robust
        configuration auditing and remediation, and others have more-targeted solutions with deep configuration auditing and
        reporting to meet a variety of auditing requirements (such as security, regulatory, Payment Card Industry Data Security
        Standard, "gold" or trusted configuration baselining). This category also contains CM database tools and supporting
        technology to discover and populate them, which includes IT service dependency mapping tools.

        CM is for production systems only. CM is distinct from software configuration management (SWCM), which is used by
        programmers to manage the change and configuration of development systems. Some SWCM and CM vendors are partnering to
        provide a linkage between systems. Finally, the CM category does not include vendors that position products primarily as
        electronic software distribution or as content distribution used in Internet distribution scenarios (B2B or
        business-to-consumer (B2C)).

        A computing device that provides predefined services, and that has its underlying operating (OS) software hidden beneath
        an application-specific interface. Computing appliances offer reduced complexity (e.g., installation, administration and
        maintenance) and faster deployment by hiding the operating software and embedding the application within the device. A
        computing appliance may be based on a general-purpose OS (e.g., Windows, Solaris or Linux) if the OS's complexity is
        hidden and the ability to load arbitrary services is removed.

        Computing appliances can provide one or more services; however, they not general-purpose devices in that they are not
        flexible in the services they provide. Administrators do not need platform expertise -- just limited application and
        appliance-specific expertise.

    term : Computing Platform Products
    abbr :
    from : ITIL glossary (2013)
    desc : |-4
        Computing platform products are defined as follows:

        -   Server systems -- The server segment comprises all multiuser systems. Please note that Gartner no longer classifies
            supercomputers and mainframes as discrete segments. As the technology, use and positioning differentiation between the
            server segments has eroded, all multiuser systems are now classified as general-purpose servers.

        -   Workstations -- Workstations are single-user systems including high-end, midrange, and entry-level workstations.
            Workstations are typically high-end complex instruction set computer (CISC), explicitly parallel instruction computing
            or RISC-based CPU architectures with high-performance graphics, OS and system architecture. In general, workstations
            must include integrated floating-point processing, integrated networking, a 32-bit or 64-bit multitasking OS, as well
            as configurations that support high-resolution graphics capabilities and 3D graphics functionality. The workstation
            market includes traditional Unix workstations, such as Linux and workstations running Windows 2000/XP or other
            advanced OSs. Gartner classifies workstations by the primary market for which they are designed and bases its data
            collection on desktops branded as workstations. Systems shipped with Windows Media Center Edition are generally
            counted as PCs and not included in the workstation category and, because they are not branded as workstations, neither
            are Apple Macintosh desktops. Examples of x86-based workstations are IBM's IntelliStation family, Dell Precision
            Workstations and HP Workstations. Note that the Intel-compatible 32-bit CPU (x86-32) category refers to Intel
            Architecture (IA)-compatible, x86-based workstations and covers a variety of chipset and processor designs not offered
            by Intel. Note also that the Itanium processor family of CPUs, such as Itanium2 and 64-bit extensions to CISC
            architecture, including as AMD's Opteron- and Athlon64-based workstations, will be listed separately under the titles
            of IA-64 and (Intel-compatible 64-bit CPU) x86-64, respectively.

        -   PCs -- PCs are single-user systems including x86 (Intel-compatible CPU) server, desk-based and mobile PCs. A PC is a
            general purpose computer that is distinguished from other computers by its adherence to hardware and software
            compatibility. This compatibility drives high-unit volumes of commoditylike products that do not require on-site
            technical support. High-performance features, such as networking, graphics and a virtual multiuser/multitasking OS,
            are normally optional and not integral system features. IBM/IBM-compatible and Apple PCs are two platforms in this
            product segment. A single-user PC's resident OS is typically Windows, Mac OS and Linux. PCs have a performance ceiling
            that is lower in system compute performance, input/output (I/O) channel speed and disk speed than advanced
            workstations. Standard graphics are in the 1024 x 768 to 1280 x 1068-pixel range, and optional high-end graphics are
            limited compared with workstations. Gartner views a PC system as a single unit, which includes a CPU, a monitor, a
            mouse and a keyboard. Furthermore, Gartner does not include thin-client terminal.

        limited to a maximum number of users at a particular time). The software vendor usually sets the guidelines on the type of
        software license. Monitoring is facilitated by the vendor or by the user. When software usage is measured by the user, the
        vendor can require a user to supply detailed reports or can rely on the user's pledge. Enterprises can avoid liability and

        A broadband line is a connection between a consumer's home and a carrier's network that provides data access services of
        at least 256 Kbps. In most cases this is a physical connection using copper-based DSL, cable modem or FTTH/FTTP with
        Ethernet in the last mile in a building. However, Gartner also includes other emerging access technologies, such as
        wireless broadband, satellite and power lines when they are used as replacement technologies for residential fixed-line
        broadband.

        Broadband services revenue includes all the retail revenue associated with providing broadband access to consumers. This
        does not include IP services revenue -- especially Internet access revenue -- that is commonly bundled with the broadband
        line. Broadband access and Internet access are two different services, and Internet access revenue is reflected in the
        Internet segment.

        systems are being driven by the enterprise market through companies such as Cisco, HP and Polycom. Consumer telepresence
        creates a greater challenge than its enterprise counterpart. While an enterprise system can cost hundreds of thousands of
        dollars and may require an environment that is ad hoc, a consumer system will need to embrace a variety of environments in
        which the majority of costs can be absorbed in other home devices, such as high-definition television (HDTV), broadband

    desc : |-4
        A **contact center system** is a computer-based system that provides call and contact routing for high-volume telephony
        transactions, with specialist answering "agent" stations and a sophisticated real-time contact management system. The
        definition includes all contact center systems that provide inbound contact handling capabilities and automatic contact
        distribution, combined with a high degree of sophistication in terms of dynamic contact traffic management.

        Contact center systems are defined as follows:

        They are software applications typically residing on an adjunct server or switch-based processor system, located either at
        a customer's premises or at a third-party site. For routing phone calls, the system providing the call control may be an
        application-specific resource or may support a dual-function PBX/automatic call distributor installation. Newer
        architectures will support contact center call routing business rules on an "application server" which can direct and
        monitor calls through a telephony gateway using SIP or other softswitch protocols. The infrastructure may also be provided
        as an on-site "managed service;" as an off-site, dedicated "hosted service" solution; or as an off-site shared resource
        "software as a service" (SaaS) solution.

        They provide intelligent routing of an incoming communication (that is, a call, e-mail, text chat, Web collaboration or
        facsimile) to the appropriate resource (that is, agent-assisted or self-service) through an algorithm more sophisticated
        than simple hunt groups.

        They provide the ability to generate historical activity reports (covering at least 30 days) as well as supervisory
        capabilities including, but not limited to, real-time monitoring and reporting of a system's workload, agent status
        lookups, viewing the number of contacts in the queue, and the ability to change agent status.

        CPM is an umbrella term that describes the methodologies, metrics, processes and systems used to monitor and manage the

        operational plans and send aggregated results. These applications are also integrated into many elements of the planning
        and control cycle, or they address BAM or customer relationship optimization needs.

        CPM must be supported by a suite of analytical applications that provide the functionality to support these processes,
        methodologies and metrics.

    term : CPM Suites
    abbr :
    from : ITIL glossary (2013)
    desc : |-4
        Gartner defines the main application components of a CPM suite as follows:

        -   Budgeting, planning and forecasting -- These applications support the development of all aspects of budgets, plans and
            forecasts. They encompass short-term financially focused budgets, longer-term plans and high-level strategic plans.
            These applications should deliver workflow capabilities to manage budget/plan creation, submission and approval, as
            well as provide the ability to dynamically create forecasts and scenarios. They also should support the development of
            an enterprisewide planning model that links operational plans with financial budgets. In addition, they must be
            capable of sharing data with domain-specific applications, such as SCP.

        -   Profitability modeling and optimization -- This includes activity-based costing (ABC) applications that determine and
            allocate costs at a highly granular level, and activity-based management applications that provide capabilities to
            enable users to model the impact on profitability of different cost and resource allocation strategies. Some
            applications have moved beyond the "traditional" ABC focus to enable revenue to be allocated in addition to costs to
            model packaging, bundling, pricing and channel strategies.

        -   Scorecard applications -- A scorecard is a generic BI capability that includes the functionality of dashboards but
            that also has the capability to link key performance indicators (KPIs) to a strategy map, with a hierarchical
            cause-and-effect relationship among the KPIs. Scorecards are often used in conjunction with a particular methodology,
            such as the balanced scorecard, European Foundation for Quality Management, value-based management or Six Sigma.

        -   Financial consolidation -- This type of application enables organizations to reconcile, consolidate, summarize and
            aggregate financial data based on different accounting standards and federal regulations. These applications are a
            fundamental part of CPM because they create the audited, enterprise-level view of financial information that must be
            shared with other CPM applications to analyze variance from targets.

        -   Statutory and financial reporting -- CPM applications require specialized reporting tools that can format output as
            structured financial statements, and they may also need to support specific generally accepted accounting principles
            (GAAP) presentation rules, such as U.S. GAAP or International Financial Reporting Standards. They also include
            visualization techniques that are specifically designed to support the analysis of variance from budgets or targets,
            such as hyperbolic trees.

    term : CSS (customer Service And Support)
    abbr :
    from : ITIL glossary (2013)
    desc : |-4
        Once known as the "complaint department", CSS is responsible for retaining and extending customer relationships once a
        product or service is sold. Due to the increasing complexity of customer interactions, customer service organizations need
        a complex technological infrastructure that is flexible, extensible and scalable and that integrates front-office
        applications with back-end processes and data. The components of CSS include:

        -   Call management -- The core functionality of CSS applications. This component is used to log all incoming telephone
            calls and transactions and to manage the transaction from initiation through closure.

        -   Internet-based customer service suites -- Also known as e-service suites, these applications and tools empower
            customers, partners and prospects for self-service and interactions with the enterprise via the Web, an intranet or an
            extranet.

        -   Field service and dispatch (FS/D) systems -- FS/D has become an essential element of complete CSS suites and is an
            important element of customer relationship management (CRM). FS/D software is evolving from solely back-office
            functionality to an enterprise system that tightly couples the back office with the front-office servicing systems.

        -   Contact centers -- Traditional call centers handle voice-only customer contact, whereas contact centers include all
            types of channels of customer contact, including voice (e.g., telephone, IVR, speech recognition and voice
            verification), the Web, fax, video kiosks and e-mail. This is an inbound and outbound service-based environment in
            which agents handle all types of contacts regarding sales, customer service, marketing, telemarketing, collections and
            other functions..
