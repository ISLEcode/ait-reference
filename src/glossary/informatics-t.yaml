    term : Tacit Knowledge
    abbr :
    from : ITIL glossary (2013)
    desc : |-4
        The personal knowledge resident within the mind, behavior and perceptions of individuals. Tacit knowledge includes skills,
        experiences, insight, intuition and judgment. Tacit knowledge is typically shared through discussion, stories, analogies
        and person-to-person interaction and is, therefore, difficult to capture or represent in explicit form. Because
        individuals continually add personal knowledge, which changes behavior and perceptions, tacit knowledge is, by definition,
        uncaptured.

    desc : |-4
        **Tag management** systems simplify the deployment and maintenance of JavaScript tags, used in online content to interface
        with applications such as Web analytics, personalization and advertising. A single tag replaces all other tags and when
        executed, the tag manager publishes other tags, based on business rules and a common data model. This decouples tag
        control and maintenance from the life cycle of other content, improves the speed of changes, the quality of tags and
        provides an audit trail.

    from : ITIL glossary (2013)
    desc : |-4
        Digital modulation technique that allocates a discrete amount of frequency bandwidth to each user to permit many
        simultaneous conversations. Each caller is assigned a specific time slot for transmission. TDMA provides improved spectral
        efficiencies over analog systems. A derivative of this standard used in North America is called NA-TDMA. Other TDMA-based
        cellular systems include GSM, D-AMPS, PDC, DECT and enhanced TDMA.

    term : TDR (time Domain Reflectometry)
    abbr :
    from : ITIL glossary (2013)
    desc : |-4
        A technique used to track faults in networks, such as cable breaks or loose connections. A pulse of a known shape is
        transmitted over the network and an echo is created when the pulse hits an obstacle or cable end. The time elapsed between
        the sending of the pulse and receiving the echo can be used to locate the origin of the echo and therefore the break.
        Sophisticated testing equipment is available to perform this test and to analyze the results.

    abbr :
    from : ITIL glossary (2013)
    desc : |-4
        **Telecom analytics** encompass sophisticated business intelligence (BI) technologies that are packaged to satisfy the
        complex requirements of telecom organizations. These include increasing sales, reducing churn and fraud, improving risk
        management and decreasing operational costs. Analytics solutions usually extend beyond the capabilities of regular BI
        solutions for reporting and dashboarding to include capabilities ranging from ad hoc querying and multidimensional
        analyses to predictive and descriptive modeling, data mining, text analytics, forecasting and optimization. The adoption
        of analytics in telecommunications is intended to improve visibility into core operations, internal processes and market
        conditions, discern trends and establish forecasts. Future analytics will also include data from systems beyond
        traditional billing and mediation sources. These will include deep packet inspection, home subscriber server, video
        optimization equipment and on-device clients, among others.

    desc : |-4
        Telecom services now include fixed-network services (data retail, Internet retail, voice retail and wholesale) and mobile
        services.

        -   Fixed-data services -- Includes all dedicated/private line, packet and circuit-switched access services (for example,
            frame relay, asynchronous transfer mode, IP, Integrated Services Digital Network, DSL, multichannel multipoint
            distribution service \[MMDS\] and satellite) retail revenue. No differentiation is made between the type of traffic or
            application carried by these services. All types of transmissions -- nonvoice data, image, video, fax, interactive
            services and even voice -- can be carried by these services regardless of whether the source format is analog or
            digital. All revenue reflects service provider annualized retail revenue -- paid for by the business and residential
            end user of the service; no wholesale or carrier-to-carrier revenue is included.

        -   Fixed-voice services -- This reflects retail voice service revenue for all services that are sold as such to end users
            and includes the provision of local and long-distance services related to voice (calling charges, line
            rental/subscription and connection fees are included in this category), enhanced voice services, data and fax
            transmission over the circuit-switched PSTN, and retail voice over IP revenue -- paid for by the business and
            residential end user of the service; no wholesale or carrier-to-carrier revenue is included.

        -   Mobile telecom services -- Income from mobile telephone calls and mobile data usage (Short Message Service \[SMS\] and
            mobile data access) from all mobile operators in that regional market. Consumer charges are removed. Income from
            mobile telephone calling charges, mobile data access, SMS charges, line rental/subscription and connection fees are
            included in this category.

        Wholesale/carrier services are not included as a component of business IT spending. Wholesale/carrier services reflect
        carrier revenue from carrier-to-carrier service transactions.

    term : Teledensity
    abbr :
    from : ITIL glossary (2013)
    desc : |-4
        Number of fixed (landline) telephone connections per 100 people in a specified geographic area. Teledensity is often used
        to compare the level of access to voice and data communications services between metropolitan and rural areas, or between
        one country and another. The governments of many emerging economies are focused on increasing teledensity as an economic
        enabler. Because of fixed-mobile substitution, teledensity is decreasing in some countries. See also FMS.

    term : Telematics
    abbr :
    from : ITIL glossary (2013)
    desc : |-4
        **Telematics** refers to the use of wireless devices and "black box" technologies to transmit data in real time back to an
        organization. Typically, it's used in the context of automobiles, whereby installed or after-factory boxes collect and
        transmit data on vehicle use, maintenance requirements or automotive servicing. Telematics can also provide real-time
        information on air bag deployments or car crashes and locate stolen vehicles by using GPS technology. In addition,
        telematics can serve as the platform for usage-based insurance, pay-per-use insurance, pay as you drive (PAYD) insurance,
        pay how you drive (PHYD) programs for fleet insurance, or teen driving programs for retail business. Telematics has
        expanded beyond personal line deployments, and can also be used by commercial auto insurers for fleet products, driver
        data and vehicle monitoring. New models are emerging, however, called "mobile telematics," in which smartphones connect to
        the car's computer system to pull data and send this to the insurer using the phone's wireless network.

    from : ITIL glossary (2013)
    desc : |-4
        These solutions are extensions of IP PBX and unified messaging (UM) products. In many cases, UM is tightly integrated with
        PBX; in others, the two are offered by separate vendors. The functionality offered is telephony-centric and typically
        includes: one-number service, supporting phone twinning, softphones (which may be proprietary), remote phones (phone login
        over the Internet) and fixed-mobile convergence (FMC). Examples of PBX- and IP PBX-centric solutions include all the
        leading PBX vendors.

    term : Tera-architectures
    abbr :
    from : ITIL glossary (2013)
    desc : |-4
        **Tera-architectures** are extremely large-scale computing systems that self-assemble from components and implement
        resilience through a software architecture designed to detect, tolerate and automatically respond to component failure.
        Due to the scale (tens or hundreds of thousands of servers running the application), components are constantly breaking,
        and failures happen often, but the resilient design allows the service to be successfully delivered to users, despite the
        hidden internal failures. Software has to change or be written specifically to operate in such an environment.

    desc : |-4
        The concept of forming one enterprisewide view of the customer across all customer contact channels (i.e., sales,
        marketing, and customer service and support). It is a complex area, requiring complex solutions to problems of
        integration, data flow, data access and marketing strategy. A critical component is the database that serves as the
        customer information repository.

    from : ITIL glossary (2013)
    desc : |-4
        Imitation of a specific terminal (VT100, for example) by a device, such as a PC, through software. PCs often use terminal
        emulation methods to connect to specific hosts, such as Digital Virtual Address Extensions (VAXs) or IBM mainframes, with
        which they would otherwise be incapable of communicating.

  - uuid : udx8ax3syo
    term : Terminal
    abbr :
    from : ITIL glossary (2013)
    desc : |-4
        A device, combining keyboard and display screen, that communicates with a computer. Terminals are divided into different
        classes depending on whether they are able to process data on their own.

        Dumb terminals -- display monitor or simple input/output (I/O) devices that send and accept data from a network server or
        mainframe. They have no built-in processing capabilities. Workers enter data and commands, which are sent to a computer
        located elsewhere.

        Smart terminals -- monitors that process limited amounts of information.

        Intelligent terminals -- devices that contain main memory and a central processing unit (CPU) to perform special display
        functions. Examples include an information kiosk and AT&T Display Phones.

        3270 terminals -- IBM display stations used to communicate with mainframes made by IBM and other manufacturers. They are
        in widespread use, and are widely copied.

    term : Text Analytics
    abbr :
    from : ITIL glossary (2013)
    desc : |-4
        **Text analytics** is the process of deriving information from text sources. It is used for several purposes, such as:
        summarization (trying to find the key content across a larger body of information or a single document), sentiment
        analysis (what is the nature of commentary on an issue), explicative (what is driving that commentary), investigative
        (what are the particular cases of a specific issue) and classification (what subject or what key content pieces does the
        text talk about).

  - uuid : udx8axa63v
    term : Text Mining

    desc : |-4
        Thermal printing is a process that uses the heat from a thermal print head to darken chemically treated paper. Thermal
        paper is coated paper that reacts to heat. When the paper passes through the printer assembly, it comes into contact with
        a thermal print head array and the heater elements turn on to activate the thermal coating, creating the image. The only
        supply item used is thermal paper.

    term : Thin Client
    abbr :
    from : ITIL glossary (2013)
    desc : |-4
        **Thin client** is used to describe a type of client/server computing in which applications are run, and data is stored,
        on the server rather than on the client. Because the applications are executed on the server, they do not require
        client-resident installation, although the graphical user interface and some application logic may be rendered to the
        client.

        A common misperception is that a thin-client application requires the use of a thin-client device (i.e., a stripped-down
        desktop machine that costs less to buy and maintain than a regular PC). However, while thin-client applications enable
        such devices to be used, they do not require it. In fact, more than 85% of devices used to display thin-client Windows
        applications are regular PCs, typically configured with both "fat-client" applications and access to thin-client ones.

    term : Thin Provisioning
    abbr :
    from : ITIL glossary (2013)
    desc : |-4
        **Thin provisioning** allocates physical capacity from a virtualized pool of storage to logical volumes on a just-in-time
        basis (also known as allocate on write), rather than preallocating large amounts of capacity in anticipation of an
        application's needs. It eliminates instances of stranded capacity and improves storage utilization rates, often into the
        75%-to-80% range.

    term : Three-schema Architecture
    abbr :
    from : ITIL glossary (2013)
    desc : |-4
        A framework for managing access to data that involves three layers or schemas: the external or programming view, the
        conceptual or data administration view, and the internal or database administration view. Such ideas were developed by an
        American National Standards Institute/Scalable Processor Architecture subcommittee in 1971 but received little practical
        implementation by database management system (DBMS) vendors. The principle is that the conceptual schema consists of
        business rules derived from a semantic data model, which provides independence between programs and data structures. The
        emphasis has since shifted to computer-aided software engineering (CASE) tools and "repository" standards.

    abbr :
    from : ITIL glossary (2013)
    desc : |-4
        **Through-silicon vias (TSVs)** involve the stacking of individual wafers (or individual dies) to form customized,
        multilayer, multifunctional devices. They are bonded together in the vertical direction using metalized holes or pillars
        as the primary interconnect method. Various types of wafers -- such as radio frequency (RF), analog, digital and memory --

        A trunk media gateway (TMG) serves as the bridge between a circuit-based trunk switch and a packet-based IP or ATM
        backbone network. In certain implementations, it completely bypasses the tandem switch (Class 4). It takes care of the
        PSTN-to-packet-network transition at the trunk level and is connected to the local or trunk exchange. A TMG has a Class 4
        interface and supports VoIP and/or VoATM.

    desc : |-4
        **Tokenization** refers to a process by which a piece of sensitive data, such as a credit card number, is replaced by a
        surrogate value known as a token. The sensitive data still generally needs to be stored securely at one centralized
        location for subsequent reference and requires strong protections around it. The security of a tokenization approach
        depends on the security of the sensitive values and the algorithm and process used to create the surrogate value and map
        it back to the original value.

        The previously described business models define the total IPTV subscriber market, with each representing an STB installed
        in a home and capable of receiving some form of IPTV. The STB may be free, rented or bought by the customer. Additional
        services such as premium channels, VOD and person-to-person video-calling can only be sold only after a subscriber has an
        STB.

        In certain specific cases consumers receive IPTV for "free" or by default as part of a "triple play" bundle of wireline
        voice, IPTV/video and broadband Internet. In other words, IPTV is supplied to them whether they want it or not -- they do
        not really make a choice to buy it.

        These subscribers receive from their IPTV provider a "free" STB and access to a small selection of channels, in return for
        signing a longer-term contract for broadband or a voice/broadband package. This category of IPTV subscriber does not have
        an equivalent in the existing pay-TV environment. It reflects the need for new IPTV operators to find ways to popularize
        the service.

        Hong Kong provides a good example. The carrier PCCW offers all its long-term broadband customers a "free" STB and access
        to a small number of channels. Though many of these customers may choose to buy extra channels, a sizable proportion stick
        with only the free channels -- if, indeed, they use the IPTV service at all.

        In France, the carrier Free offers all its subscribers a home gateway device with STB capability built-in. All Free's
        customers who live close enough to its asymmetric digital subscriber line (ADSL)-enabled exchanges receive a selection of
        basic IPTV channels automatically for no extra payment.

        **Track and trace** technologies enable a product's status to be captured through the value chain, and to retrospectively
        identify and verify its path. Solutions typically include elements for: (1) associating products or materials with unique
        identifiers (UIDs); (2) capturing events at various points in the supply chain; and (3) performing analytics and reporting
        on the information. Some solutions include messaging to share information with regulatory agencies or trading partners,
        and some also support capabilities for product authentication.

        **Transparency** is a condition where the material facts of an enterprise are made available in a timely, and preferably
        reusable, manner.

        Material facts encompass reliable information critical to the decision making of both internal and external stakeholders.

        The object of transparency is the enterprise (not an individual).

        Reusability allows consumers of information to construct their own analyses without compromising the contextual meaning of
        the material facts.

        Transmitter-receiver device on a satellite that transmits signals automatically when it receives predetermined signals.
        The term "satellite transponder" refers collectively to a transmitter-receiver subsystem on board the satellite that
        processes, amplifies and retransmits a range of frequencies (the transponder bandwidth) to another
        location/terminal/antenna on the earth. There are many transponders on a typical satellite, each capable of supporting one
        or more communication channels. In a few limited instances, satellite transponders can transmit directly to other
        satellites; this is known as satellite mesh topologies. These systems tend to be more expensive to build, and services are
        more expensive for end users.

    term : Type A, B And C Enterprises
    abbr :
    from : ITIL glossary (2013)
    desc : |-4
        A Gartner framework that classifies enterprises or their subdivisions according to a technology adoption profile.
        Classification is based not only on an enterprise's current technology adoption strategy, but also on whether the strategy
        is supported by senior management and is adequately funded.

        Type A enterprises are typically technically aggressive and well-funded, and use IT to gain a competitive advantage.

        Type B enterprises, which are in the majority, are mainstream IT users with adequate funding that use IT for productivity.

         Type C enterprises are technologically conservative and risk-averse, and seek to control IT costs.

        Recognizing an enterprise's type offers company strategists a meaningful way to compare an enterprise's use of technology
        against that of competitors, and to make decisions about when, how and where to adopt new technologies.
