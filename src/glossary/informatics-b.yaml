        Refers to the IT usage scenario where a form of Web services -- SOAP, WS-\* or Web-native implementation, such as
        representational state transfer (REST) or plain old XML (POX) -- is deployed in some combination of cloud and B2B
        (multienterprise) integration projects. Web services are used as a multienterprise extension of internal service-oriented
        architectures (SOAs), or in lieu of more traditional approaches to multienterprise integration, such as Applicability
        Statement 2 (AS2), electronic data interchange (EDI) and FTP.

    desc : |-4
        A **balanced scorecard (BSC)** is a performance measurement and management approach that recognizes that financial
        measures by themselves are not sufficient and that an enterprise needs a more holistic, balanced set of measures which
        reflects the different drivers that contribute to superior performance and the achievement of the enterprise's strategic
        goals. The balanced scorecard is driven by the premise that there is a cause-and-effect link between learning, internal
        efficiencies and business processes, customers, and financial results.

    term : Bandwidth As Currency
    abbr :
    from : ITIL glossary (2013)
    desc : |-4
        **Bandwidth as currency** initially involved customers purchasing a prepaid phone card that allowed subscribers to
        transfer surplus telecommunication minutes to other subscribers using text messages. Suppliers can be paid in the same
        way, and a bank of phone minute credits can be maintained and sold to others in the network. Cloud computing introduces an
        additional concept by creating an environment for the dynamic management of compute capabilities that can be traded.

    term : Bandwidth
    abbr :
    from : ITIL glossary (2013)
    desc : |-4
        **Bandwidth** can be defined as follows:

        The range of frequencies that can pass over a given transmission channel. The bandwidth determines the rate at which
        information can be transmitted through the circuit: the greater the bandwidth, the more information that can be sent in a
        given amount of time. Bandwidth is typically measured in bits per second. Increasing bandwidth potential has become a high
        priority for network planners due to the growth of multimedia, including videoconferencing, and the increased use of the
        Internet.

        The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of a modulated signal is tested within a range of frequencies on either side of the
        carrier frequency. This range is also called a bandwidth. In the case of videodiscs, it is often 15 kilohertz (kHz) on
        either side.

    term : Bank Tiers
    abbr :
    from : ITIL glossary (2013)
    desc : |-4
        **Bank tiers** can be defined as follows:

        Tier 1 includes between 20 and 25 global bank assets and/or capital markets price makers with daily trading volume
        exceeding 50,000 transactions. These banks want software using open architecture on a framework on which they can leverage
        tools, such as analytics.

        Tier 2 constitutes about 200 international and national banks and/or capital markets price takers, as well as trading
        volume averaging about 30,000 transactions daily. Such banks seek new technology with a complete vertical integration of
        functions. Cross-asset functionality is not a concern, except for structuring deals because of the specialized focus of
        their trading businesses. They desire analytics and a front- to back-office suite to improve transparency and risk
        management.

        Tier 3 consists of approximately 1,000 banks, including smaller national and regional banks, and capital markets price
        takers. These banks want cross-asset platforms, but don't have the requisite IT resources in-house and must rely on
        vendors. Their biggest concern is implementation risk.

        Tier 4 comprises smaller regional institutions with a primary focus on core banking and limited capital markets trading.
        Such firms often source their capital markets requirements through third parties and tend to use an ASP approach.

    term : Battery-Powered Radio Frequency Identification (RFID)
    abbr :
    from : ITIL glossary (2013)
    desc : |-4
        There are two types of **battery-powered radio frequency identification (RFID)** tags: battery-assisted passive (BAP) tags
        and active tags, which are used to collect and communicate asset-level information. BAP tags, which were standardized in
        2010 in ISO/IEC 18000-6C:2010 Class 3, use a battery for operating the internal circuitry that facilitates the collection,
        processing and storage of ancillary information. The additional energy may also be used to boost the communication process
        in difficult usage scenarios, such as personnel tags. Active (Generation 2 Class 4) tags use batteries to power all
        functions of the tag--the receiving and transmitting of a signal, as well as the power for the processing and memory
        chips. Both solutions differ from passive-only tags, where there is no battery for communication, additional processing or
        storage. Although active and BAP tags can technically be implemented at all frequencies in which RFID is used, they are
        most common at 433 MHz, 900 MHz and 2.4 GHz.

    abbr :
    from : ITIL glossary (2013)
    desc : |-4
        **Baud** is a unit of signaling speed. The speed in bauds is the number of discrete changes per second in some aspect of a
        signal (e.g., voltage in a wire). Transmission speeds are now more commonly measured bits per second (bps), rather than
        bauds. The two terms were roughly synonymous until modems began to exceed 2,400 bps, after which they diverged more widely
        as modem speed has increased. Modems now use coding techniques to transmit more than one bit per baud, making their true
        baud ratings irrelevant.

    desc : |-4
        BLEs are platforms intended to enable the discovery, visualization and analysis of recurring, complex, multiperiod
        patterns in large operational performance data sets. If such engines are to realize their intent, they must support four
        layers of cumulative functionality:

        Variable designation--this supports the selection of the system properties that are to be tracked by the platform and how
        those properties are to be measured;

        Variable value normalization -- this is the automated ability to determine (usually by an algorithm that regresses
        measurements) what constitutes the normal or usual values assumed by the system property measuring variables;

        Observational dependency modeling -- this is a set of tools for linking the individual property measuring variables to one
        another, where the links represent some kind of dependency among the values taken by the linked variables; commercially
        available BLEs differ significantly with regard to the degree to which the dependencies must be pre-established by the
        vendor or user and the degree to which the dependencies are themselves discovered by BLE algorithms working on the
        performance data sets being considered;

        Assessment -- the means by which, once the normalized values and dependency map are determined, the resulting construct
        can be used to answer questions about the values assumed by some variables, based on the values assumed by others.

        **Benchmarking** is defined as the comparison between vendor performance and designated benchmark organizations or
        indexes. An index is a publicly available indicator for a factor that is associated with a pricing element.

        Internal benchmarking is the continuous process of measuring a company's products, services and practices to determine
        whether the best possible job is performed with the resources at hand. This can include comparing similar functions of
        different operating units in an organization or comparing the operations of a specific division from one year to the next.

        External benchmarking is the continuous process of measuring a company's products, services and practices and comparing
        them with those of another company. This can include comparisons with industry peers, functional leaders, or best-in-class
        performers.

        **Best-in-class** is defined as the superior product within a category of hardware or software. It does not necessarily
        mean best product overall, however. For example, the best-in-class product in a low-priced category may be inferior to the
        best product on the market, which could sell for much more.

        A **best-of-breed** product has been identified as the best product of its type. Enterprises often purchase software from
        different vendors to obtain the best-of-breed offering for each application area. For example, enterprises may purchase a
        human-resource package from one vendor and an accounting package from another. Although enterprise resource planning (ERP)
        vendors offer numerous enterprise applications and claim that their integrated system is a superior solution, all modules
        in an ERP system are rarely best-of-breed.

        A **biometric characteristic** is a measurable physiological or behavioral trait of a living person, especially one that
        can be used to determine or verify the identity of a person in access control or criminal forensics. Most real adoption of
        biometric technologies during the next five years will come from government applications (for example, immigration, social
        security and surveillance), although corporate adoption will continue to grow slowly until biometric readers are routinely
        embedded in hardware, such as notebooks. Typical biometric measures include fingerprints, retinal recognition, facial
        thermograms and voice recognition.

        **Bluetooth** is a low-power wireless networking technology operating in the 2.4 GHz unlicensed Industrial, Scientific and
        Medical (ISM) band. There are two classes of Bluetooth device -- Class 1 devices have higher output power and a range of
        about 100 meters, and Class 2 devices have lower power and a range of about 10 meters. Bluetooth enables ad hoc networking
        of up to eight devices (supporting voice and data). The Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG) was founded in 1998 by IBM,
        Intel, Ericsson, Nokia and Toshiba, and is supported by more than 2,500 organizations. The Bluetooth v.1.0 specification
        was ratified and published in 1999 and supported data rates of up to 1Mbps. Bluetooth Version 2.1, along with its enhanced
        data rate (EDR) specification, was ratified in March 2007, supporting data rates of up to 3 Mbps, and simplified "pairing"
        -- the process used for securely linking one Bluetooth device to another. It also reduced power consumption, doubling the
        battery life of headsets and other mobile devices for which the Bluetooth radio consumes a large percentage of the power
        budget. Version 3.0 ("Seattle" was adopted by the SIG in April 2009, and the specification included Wi-Fi as an
        alternative transport layer for large volumes of data, supporting data rates of up to 24 Mbps. The SIG also adopted
        "Bluetooth low energy", a new ultra-low-power variant, previously referred to as Ultra Low Power (ULP) Bluetooth and

        Together, these disciplines provide a fresh approach to improving the performance of business processes. A BPM effort may
        be initiated from a business unit, the IT organization or an internal operational unit that may focus on innovation,
        transformation, organizational development, change management, enterprise architecture, government delivery services,
        audit/compliance and so on.

        **Business process management suites (BPMSs)** are the leading application infrastructures to support BPM projects and
        programs. A BPMS supports the entire process improvement life cycle -- from process discovery, definition and design to
        implementation, monitoring and analysis, and through ongoing optimization. Its model-driven approach enables business and
        IT professionals to work together more collaboratively throughout the life cycle than is possible with other approaches to
        solution delivery.
