    desc : |-4
        **Object-based middleware** is runtime software that enables objects (components) to work cooperatively with a container
        program or another object, even if the software is distributed across multiple computers.

    term : Object Class
    abbr :
    from : ITIL glossary (2013)
    desc : |-4
        **Object class** is the grouping of objects that can be described in terms of the attributes its members have in common.
        Generic e-mail, for example, could be an object class, because all e-mail systems have certain things in common.

    term : Object Data Model
    abbr :
    from : ITIL glossary (2013)
    desc : |-4
        An **object data model** is a data model based on object-oriented programming, associating methods (procedures) with
        objects that can benefit from class hierarchies. Thus, "objects" are levels of abstraction that include attributes and
        behavior. An object-oriented data model is one that extends the individual program space into the world of persistent
        object management and shareability.

    term : Object Late Binding
    abbr :
    from : ITIL glossary (2013)
    desc : |-4
        **Object late binding** is a runtime interpretation of messages. Using late binding, objects are integrated at runtime, as
        opposed to compiling an integrated object. This greatly enhances flexibility.

    term : Object-Oriented Analysis And Design
    abbr :
    from : ITIL glossary (2013)
    desc : |-4
        **Object-oriented analysis and design (OOA&D)** tools support object analysis and design technologies and commonly use
        Unified Modeling Language (UML) notation with a variety of methodologies to assist in the creation of highly modular and
        reusable software. Most also support the use of Domain Specific Language concepts as a complement to UML. Applications,
        data, networks and computing systems are treated as objects that can be mixed and matched flexibly rather than as
        components of a system with built-in relationships. As a result, an application does not need to be tied to a specific
        system, or data to a specific application. Please note that the UML standard from Object Management Group (OMG) has become
        the de facto standard for OOA&D tools.

    term : Object-Oriented Database Management System
    abbr :
    from : ITIL glossary (2013)
    desc : |-4
        An**object-oriented database management system (OODBMS)** applies concepts of object-oriented programming, and applies
        them to the management of persistent objects on behalf of multiple users, with capabilities for security, integrity,
        recovery and contention management. An OODBMS is based on the principles of "objects," namely abstract data types,
        classes, inheritance mechanisms, polymorphism, dynamic binding and message passing.

    term : Object-Oriented Programming
    abbr :
    from : ITIL glossary (2013)
    desc : |-4
        **Object-oriented programming (OOP)**  is a style of programming characterized by the identification of classes of objects
        closely linked with the methods (functions) with which they are associated. It also includes ideas of inheritance of
        attributes and methods. It is a technique based on a mathematical discipline, called "abstract data types," for storing
        data with the procedures needed to process that data. OOP offers the potential to evolve programming to a higher level of
        abstraction.

    term : Object-Oriented System
    abbr :
    from : ITIL glossary (2013)
    desc : |-4
        In an **object-oriented system** , all data is represented as discrete objects with which the user and other objects may
        interact. Each object contains data as well as information about the executable file needed to interpret that data. An
        object-oriented system allows the user to focus completely on tasks rather than tools. Examples of object-oriented
        programming languages include C++ and Smalltalk.

  - uuid : udx89w2spe
    term : Object-Oriented Technology
    abbr :
    from : ITIL glossary (2013)
    desc : |-4
        **Object-oriented technology (OOT)**  is a software design model in which objects contain both data and the instructions
        that work on the data. It is increasingly deployed in distributed computing.

    term : Object Request Broker
    abbr :
    from : ITIL glossary (2013)
    desc : |-4
        **Object request brokers (ORBs)** are an enriched middleware platform -- compared with their predecessors, RPC middleware
        -- including program activation, which most RPCs did not offer. Full-featured CORBA ORBs are transactional platforms, with
        a special affinity for the object-oriented programming model, including the activation and communications services that
        are particularly geared to the object-oriented software model. ORB vendors added transaction management, security and
        other features to their ORBs to enable demanding production applications. OMG CORBA emerged as the widely shared standard
        programming model for ORBs.

    abbr :
    from : ITIL glossary (2013)
    desc : |-4
        **Object role modeling** is a proprietary method that uses English to convey data design elements. The object is to enable
        developers to easily present the elements to end users who are unfamiliar with modeling notation.

    term : Object Transaction Monitor
    abbr :
    from : ITIL glossary (2013)
    desc : |-4
        An **object transaction monitor (OTM)**  is an application program -- similar to the mainframe Customer Information
        Control System (CICS) in function, but not in spirit -- that represents a consistent model of an application for a modular
        and potentially highly distributed environment.

    term : Occam Process
    abbr :
    from : ITIL glossary (2013)
    desc : |-4
        The **Occam Process** is a solderless approach to electronics manufacturing. The process utilizes a reverse-order
        interconnection solution that employs mature, low-risk, familiar basic assembly technologies in a novel sequence.
        Components are interconnected by means of printing or plating after they are held into their final positions via an
        encapsulation process, thus eliminating conventional printed circuit boards (PCBs) and traditional solder.

    term : ODP (on-device Portal)
    abbr :
    from : ITIL glossary (2013)
    desc : |-4
        Small downloadable mobile applications provided by media companies, handset vendors and some operators that make it easier
        for users to obtain new services such as music, videos, games and applications "off-deck" -- that is, from independent
        websites. The traditional operator approach to media distribution has been to allow access only to an operator-controlled
        "walled garden" of content. This has not been popular with consumers, and many operators now allow open access to the
        Internet, seeking revenue growth from increased data traffic. Examples of ODPs include the Apple iPhone's top-level menu
        and mobile clients such as Flickr and Facebook. See also off-deck portal.

    desc : |-4
        **Olfactory interfaces** synthesize odorants from a digital signature. They consist of a palette of odorants, a flow
        delivery system, and a control algorithm that determines the mixing ratios, concentration and timing of the stimulus. The
        palette stores odorants in either gel or microencapsulated form, and the diffuser is typically a set of nozzles equipped
        with microvalves or ink jet printer nozzles that release gels or liquid droplets by means of electrostatics or heat. A
        full interface also recognizes odors given off by users.

        offer of employment to the point at which the new employee is productive at work. The onboarding software includes
        administrative activities (enrolling in benefits), provisioning activities (assigning office space, user identification
        and employer property) and orientation (connecting with colleagues and training). Some organizations include employee
        performance management as part of onboarding.

    term : Online Transaction Processing
    abbr :
    from : ITIL glossary (2013)
    desc : |-4
        **Online transaction processing (OLTP)**  is a mode of processing that is characterized by short transactions recording
        business events and that normally requires high availability and consistent, short response times. This category of
        applications requires that a request for service be answered within a predictable period that approaches "real time."
        Unlike traditional mainframe data processing, in which data is processed only at specific times, transaction processing
        puts terminals online, where they can update the database instantly to reflect changes as they occur. In other words, the
        data processing models the actual business in real time, and a transaction transforms this model from one business state
        to another. Tasks such as making reservations, scheduling and inventory control are especially complex; all the
        information must be current.

        An **operating system (OS)** is software that, after being loaded into the computer by an initial boot program, manages a
        computer's resources, controlling the flow of information into and from a main processor. OSs perform complex tasks, such
        as memory management, control of displays and other input/output peripheral devices, networking and file management, and
        other resource allocation functions between software and system components. The OS provides the foundation on which
        applications, middleware and other infrastructure components function. An OS usually provides user interfaces, such as
        command-line shell and GUI, for interaction between user and computer.

    desc : |-4
        An **operational data store (ODS)**  is an alternative to having operational decision support system (DSS) applications
        access data directly from the database that supports transaction processing (TP). While both require a significant amount
        of planning, the ODS tends to focus on the operational requirements of a particular business process (for example,
        customer service), and on the need to allow updates and propagate those updates back to the source operational system from
        which the data elements were obtained. The data warehouse, on the other hand, provides an architecture for decision makers
        to access data to perform strategic analysis, which often involves historical and cross-functional data and the need to
        support many applications.
