    desc : |-4
        **Variable bit rate (VBR)** is an asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) quality of service category, defined by the ATM Forum.
        Both real-time variable bit rate (rtVBR) and non real-time variable bit rate (nrtVBR) are defined. Apart from the traffic
        parameters for peak cell rate (PCR) and sustainable cell rate (which defines the average bit rate required by the
        application), additional quality-of-service parameters such as maximum cell transfer delay, cell delay variation and
        maximum burst size must be agreed upon. The typical application for which it is used is compressed voice and
        videoconferencing for rtVBR, and response-time-sensitive data such as Systems Network Architecture (SNA) for nrtVBR.

    term : Vendor Management
    abbr :
    from : ITIL glossary (2013)
    desc : |-4
        **Vendor management** is a discipline that enables organizations to control costs, drive service excellence and mitigate
        risks to gain increased value from their vendors throughout the deal life cycle.

        Gartner's vendor management research helps clients select the right vendors; categorize vendors to ensure the right
        contract, metrics and relationship; determine the ideal number of vendors; mitigate risk when using vendors; and establish
        a vendor management organization that best fits the enterprise.

        This enables organizations to optimally develop, manage and control vendor contracts, relationships and performance for
        the efficient delivery of contracted products and services. This can help clients meet business objectives, minimize
        potential business disruption, avoid deal and delivery failure, and ensure more-sustainable multisourcing, while driving
        the most value from their vendors.

    term : Vendor-Neutral
    abbr :
    from : ITIL glossary (2013)
    desc : |-4
        **Vendor-neutral** describes a state in which no one vendor can control the definition, revision or distribution of a
        specification. Vendor-neutral specifications encourage the development of competing yet compatible implementations,
        freeing the purchaser to choose from a multitude of vendors without suffering a loss of functionality. Vendor-neutral
        specifications must be comprehensive, consistent, and either publicly available or licensed at a nominal fee.
        Additionally, they must be defined by a multilateral association that is representative of a broad cross-section of the
        computer industry, open to new members, publishes the rules of membership and operates according to democratic principles.
        Preferably, a vendor-neutral specification is supplemented with at least one reference implementation. This reference
        would be available in a format that allows re-creation -- that format would be source code for software implementations --
        and a set of conformance tests that sufficiently ensure the implementation's integrity under all reasonable conditions of
        projected use.

    desc : |-4
        **Vendor risk management (VRM)** is the process of ensuring that the use of service providers and IT suppliers does not
        create an unacceptable potential for business disruption or a negative impact on business performance. VRM technology
        supports enterprises that must assess, monitor and manage their risk exposure from third-party suppliers (TPSs) that
        provide IT products and services, or that have access to enterprise information.

    desc : |-4
        A **vendor** is the last entity in the chain that brands a product and sells it directly to end users or through a
        channel. A vendor may design and manufacture its own products, assemble complete systems from components produced by
        others, or procure products from an original equipment or contract manufacturer. A vendor may also provide services,
        maintenance or nonmaintenance for its own products or for other vendors' products and may also provide services for IT
        technologies.

    desc : |-4
        A **versatile authentication server or service (VAS)** is a single authentication product or service supporting user
        authentication in multiplatform environments (on-premises and in the cloud). It may be delivered as server software, a
        virtual or hardware appliance, or a cloud-based service. In addition to the VAS vendor's own and OEMed proprietary
        methods, if any, a VAS must support either open authentication methods or third-party proprietary authentication methods,
        without the need for separate third-party authentication servers or services.

    desc : |-4
        **Very high-speed digital subscriber lines (VDSL)** are extremely high-speed digital subscriber line (DSL) connections
        over short distances. VDSL offers speeds from 13 Mbps to more than 100 Mbps over distances of between 1,000 and 4,500 feet
        -- the shorter the distance, the higher the speed. VDSL comes in both asymmetrical and symmetrical flavors and in
        different configurations. Most advanced VDSL deployments use VDSL2, which promises up to 100 Mbps bandwidth. We account
        for all VDSL technologies together in our generic VDSL (VDSLx) category.

    term : Very Small Aperture Terminal (VSAT)
    abbr :
    from : ITIL glossary (2013)
    desc : |-4
        A **very small aperture terminal (VSAT)** is a small-sized earth station used in the transmit/receive of data, voice and
        video signals over a satellite communication network, excluding broadcast television. A VSAT consists of two parts: a
        transceiver placed outdoors in direct line of sight to the satellite, and a device that is placed indoors to interface the
        transceiver with the end user's communications device, such as a PC. The transceiver receives or sends a signal to a
        satellite transponder in the sky. The satellite sends and receives signals from a ground station computer that acts as a
        hub for the system. Each end user is interconnected with the hub station via the satellite, forming a star topology. The
        hub controls the entire operation of the network. For one end user to communicate with another, each transmission must
        first go to the hub station, which then retransmits it via the satellite to the other end user's VSAT. VSAT data
        throughput speeds have increased significantly throughout the years and now can provide multimegabit service in downstream
        and upstream. Antenna/dish sizes usually range from 1.2 meters to approximately 3 meters in diameter. Generally, these
        systems operate in Ku-band and C-band frequencies, but with the launch of Ka-band satellites by a number of operators in
        North America and Asia/Pacific, and with newer Ka-band satellites planned for Europe, high-bandwidth, bidirectional VSAT
        services for enterprise, government and other users will increasingly migrate to these satellites.

    desc : |-4
        **Video on demand (VOD)** is a generic term covering several areas. It includes all video content requested on-demand by
        users. This could be premium movies or libraries of TV shows, sporting events or concerts. It could also include
        user-created video content. In addition, some IPTV operators are starting to offer the ability to see all the TV programs
        aired on their multichannel pay-TV channels in the previous 24 or 48 hours on demand. This video content is held in a
        constantly updated library hosted by their network.

        VOD services are sold either on a pay-per-view basis or as monthly subscriptions. Bundling in flat-rate packages with
        multichannel subscriptions is also common. Gartner's definition of VOD excludes free VOD downloads, which may be used to
        increase customers' awareness of these services or to generate advertising revenue.

        A **virtual LAN (VLAN)** is a set of systems that, regardless of higher-layer addressing or location, is designated as a
        logical LAN and treated as a set of contiguous systems on a single LAN segment. Virtual LANs can be proprietary or
        standardized using the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 802.1Q. Typical grouping parameters for
        VLANs include the port number of the hub, switch or router, the higher-layer protocol such as Internet Protocol (IP) or
        Internetwork Packet Exchange (IPX), the Media Access Control (MAC) address, and the traditional subnet. The goal of VLANs
        is to provide simpler administration, simple moves/adds/changes to network devices, and partitioning at the MAC layer.

        A **virtual machine (VM)** is a software implementation of a hardware-like architecture, which executes predefined
        instructions in a fashion similar to a physical central processing unit (CPU). A VM can be used to create a cross-platform
        computing environment that loads and runs on computers independently of their underlying CPUs and operating systems. A
        notable example is the Java Virtual Machine, the environment created on a host computer to run Java applets. Although VMs
        have existed longer than Java, Java has made VMs highly visible.

        A **virtual tape library (VTL)** is a disk appliance that has special software that makes the device appear as a physical
        tape drive or tape library to the backup application; the device is accessed through standard tape interfaces. The backup
        software believes it is writing the backup data to a real tape cartridge when it is, in fact, writing to a specially
        configured file on the disk appliance. Similarly, the backup software will use the appliance for recovery, accessing the
        device as if the recovery is coming from tape, when it is actually being transferred from disk spindles on the appliance.
        At its essence, a VTL is both a disk-based appliance and a tape-like interface.

        **Voice endpoint** describes a voice device, like a telephone, as a terminating device. This could be a physical extension
        or a logical IP address. This particularly applies to IP telephones where 100% IP system functions are not fully used for
        voice telephones and terminals.

        **Voice of the customer (VoC)** solutions combine multiple, traditionally siloed technologies associated with the capture,
        storage and analysis of direct, indirect and inferred customer feedback. Technologies such as social media monitoring,
        enterprise feedback management, speech analytics, text mining and Web analytics are integrated to provide a holistic view
        of the customer's voice. The resultant customer insights are acted on by disseminating relevant information to the right
        person at the right time on the right channel.

        **Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP)** is based on an IP standard that is capable of transporting voice and data packets
        over the same network. Unlike circuit-switched networks, IP doesn't require a dedicated connection for an entire call.
        Voice signals are converted to packets that are sent across the network and reassembled in the correct order when they
        reach their destination. VoIP services can be deployed over the Internet or private IP networks (LAN/WLAN).

    desc : |-4
        In its widest sense, **voice switching, control and applications (VSCA)** refers to the functions performed in a network
        that alter the path taken by information as it traverses that network, whether in real time or near real time. In this
        sense, switching includes packet-routing technologies (for example, Internet Protocol \[IP\], asynchronous transfer mode
        \[ATM\] and frame relay). The markets tracked in the switching category include well-known ones, such as softswitches,
        call session control function (CSCF), application servers and media gateways.

    desc : |-4
        **Volumetric displays** create visual representations of objects in three dimensions, with an almost 360-degree spherical
        viewing angle in which the image changes as the viewer moves around. True volumetric displays fall into two categories:
        swept volume displays and static volume displays. Swept volume displays use the persistence of human vision to re-create
        volumetric images from rapidly projected 2D "slices." Static volume displays use no major moving parts to display images,
        but rather rely on a 3D volume of active elements (Volumetric Picture Elements, or voxels) changing color (or
        transparency) to display a solid option.
