    desc : |-4
        Describes a contract that defines the vendor's contribution to the customer in terms of specific benefits to the
        customer's business. Such a contract also defines the payment the customer will make according to the vendor's performance
        in delivering those business benefits. Gain-sharing contracts require the development of a delivery paradigm that links a
        customer's business metrics to a vendor's IT solution. The key elements of this paradigm, in order, are:

        1.Business metric definition and selection

        2.Client metric benchmarking

        3.Development of key performance indicators

        4.Investment options evaluation

        5.Gain-sharing contract development

        6.Financial engineering

        7.Delivery of services

        8.Re-evaluation and adjustment of metrics

    term : Galileo
    abbr :
    from : ITIL glossary (2013)
    desc : |-4
        A planned Global Positioning Satellite System (GPSS) of 30 low-earth orbit satellites backed by the European Union and the
        European Space Agency and originally due for commercial operation in 2008. Galileo was delayed by funding problems,
        because private enterprise had showed little interest. The European Parliament agreed with the Council of Europe in
        November 2007 to finance the deployment entirely from European Union funds, and after a validation phase due for
        completion in 2010, the service is now scheduled to go into operation in 2013. Galileo will complement the U.S.
        Government's GPS system, which ran into problems with development delays for replacement satellites. The Russian Global
        Navigation Satellite System (GLONASS) has been guaranteed funding through 2009 and is being expanded to provide worldwide
        coverage with the launch of additional satellites during 2009.

    desc : |-4
        **Gamification** is the use of game mechanics to drive engagement in non-game business scenarios and to change behaviors
        in a target audience to achieve business outcomes. Many types of games include game mechanics such as points, challenges,
        leaderboards, rules and incentives that make game-play enjoyable. Gamification applies these to motivate the audience to
        higher and more meaningful levels of engagement. Humans are "hard-wired" to enjoy games and have a natural tendency to
        interact more deeply in activities that are framed in a game construct.

        Previously known as unlicensed mobile access (UMA), a **GAN (generic access network)** is a network architecture designed
        to support seamless connectivity between wide-area cellular networks, such as GSM/GPRS, and LAN technologies, such as
        Wi-Fi or Bluetooth -- it is an example of fixed-mobile convergence.

    abbr :
    from : ITIL glossary (2013)
    desc : |-4
        A server designed to transform data streams to better match device capabilities. For example, Wireless Application
        Protocol (WAP) gateway servers convert HTML to Wireless Markup Language (WML) for wireless devices, and a number of
        products can reformat HTML for devices such as mobile phones and personal digital assistants (PDAs). Today, HTML-based
        servers predominate. While HTML can be made aware of a unique device requesting content, more often "shadow" Web server
        applications are created to draw off and reformat the native content.

    desc : |-4
        1.A computer that sits between different networks or applications. The gateway converts information, data or other
        communications from one protocol or format to another. A router may perform some of the functions of a gateway. An
        Internet gateway can transfer communications between an enterprise network and the Internet. Because enterprises often use
        protocols on their local-area networks (LANs) that differ from those of the Internet, a gateway will often act as a
        protocol converter so that users can send and receive communications over the Internet.

        2.A product or feature that uses proprietary techniques to link heterogeneous systems.

        **Gaze control** is about effecting computer action by changing the direction of one's gaze. This involves determining the
        angle or position of a user's visual attention, usually through the use of cameras, and choosing from a set of available
        instructions that are mapped to those positions.

        **Generation scheduling** tools analyze the electric power system network operations and the economic dispatch of each
        power plant to optimize overall energy delivery under given constraints, such as carbon dioxide emissions or transmission
        stability limits. Scheduling tools support different planning horizons, such as hourly, daily, weekly, monthly and
        annually, as well as 10-year plans for long-term unit commitment and maintenance scheduling.

        **Geospatial mashups** are applications that can display many sources of information and the geographical relationships
        among them. A mashup is a lightweight, Web-based, composite application, with no native data store or content repository.
        What makes a mashup geospatial is the ability to view multiple data repositories or even real-time data streams within a
        consistent geospatial context. Vendors may embed business intelligence (BI) functionality and in-memory online analytical
        processing (OLAP) in more comprehensive product offerings.

    term : Geothermal Cooling For Data Centers
    abbr :
    from : ITIL glossary (2013)
    desc : |-4
        **Geothermal cooling** is different from using geothermal energy to generate power. It uses the near-constant temperature
        of the earth just below the surface to provide cooling capability. Geothermal cooling is not new; throughout history,
        people have kept foods and beverages, such as wine, cool by storing them below ground in cellars. For data centers,
        geothermal cooling is implemented using a closed-loop piping system filled with water and/or a coolant that runs through
        vertical wells under the ground, filled with a heat-transferring fill.

    term : Geothermal Power Generation
    abbr :
    from : ITIL glossary (2013)
    desc : |-4
        **Geothermal power** is a highly geographically variable renewable energy source. Traditionally, energy is produced from
        geothermal resources that have a combination of three attributes: high temperature rock, saturation of the rock mass and
        high permeability to allow water (the heat transfer agent) to move throughout the target geothermal field. Since
        geothermal power output can be maintained at a steady rate, it can be used as a renewable source of base load, unlike wind
        and solar.

        **Gesture control** is the ability to recognize and interpret movements of the human body in order to interact with and
        control a computer system without direct physical contact. The term "natural user interface" is becoming commonly used to
        describe these interface systems, reflecting the general lack of any intermediate devices between the user and the system.

        **Global delivery model (GDM)** refers to the assets and competencies (IT skills/labor resources, tools, policies and
        procedures, methodologies, infrastructure, management, human resource functions, and delivery processes) of an
        organization's service provider (internal or external) to source skills from global locations for IT/business benefit. In
        an optimized GDM, the disparate set of resources comes together seamlessly; factors such as high process maturity and a
        secure and scalable global infrastructure supported by significant investments to mitigate or manage risk are critical.

        **Global regulatory management** represents key capabilities that a life science company must possess to operate in a
        global regulatory environment that is increasingly complex and in a state of continuous change. Key capabilities that we
        will highlight are clinical trial disclosure, product registrations and submission tracking/management. Each capability
        area addresses a discrete but related need, driven by regulatory authorities around the globe, that must be met to be able
        to gain product approvals, market authorizations to sell, and management of key processes to maintain compliance in each
        country that a life science company operates in. These capabilities coexist with and leverage other systems, such as
        regulatory document management and submission systems.

        **Grid computing** refers to using computers managed by more than one organization, whether internal or external, to
        collectively accomplish large tasks, such as derivative risk analysis, candidate drug screening or complex simulations.
        The management domains can be separate companies, separate divisions of one company, or different data centers and
        operating organizations inside one company. The computers involved can be dedicated to the grid, or they can contribute
        spare cycles to run grid work; grid computing also applies to a private cloud used to run grid workloads. Grid computing
        does not include the use of public cloud-based computers, either partially or fully. We refer to those situations as
        cloud-based grid computing.

        Software that supports interpersonal processes and the objects with which people commonly work. Groupware was originally
        coined to describe a new class of applications designed to provide electronic support for groups of individuals working
        together toward a common goal. The term has been applied to applications ranging from unstructured electronic mail to
        rigorously structured workflow systems. Groupware is more useful as a concept when it is broken down into three major
        stages: communication, coordination and cooperation. In this light, groupware applications can be viewed in terms of the
        degree of structure in the group interaction and in the complexity of that structure, and the rigor with which the
        activity itself is monitored.

    desc : |-4
        A graphics-based operating system interface that uses icons, menus and a mouse (to click on the icon or pull down the
        menus) to manage interaction with the system. Developed by Xerox, the GUI was popularized by the Apple Macintosh in the
        1980s. At the time, Microsoft's operating system, MS-DOS, required the user to type specific commands, but the company's
        GUI, Microsoft Windows, is now the dominant user interface for personal computers (PCs). A comprehensive GUI environment
        includes four components: a graphics library, a user interface toolkit, a user interface style guide and consistent
        applications. The graphics library provides a high-level graphics programming interface. The user interface toolkit, built
        on top of the graphics library, provides application programs with mechanisms for creating and managing the dialogue
        elements of the windows, icons, menus, pointers and scroll bars (WIMPS) interface. The user interface style guide
        specifies how applications should employ the dialogue elements to present a consistent, easy-to-use environment (i.e.,
        "look and feel") to the user. Application program conformance with a single user interface style is the primary
        determinant of ease of learning and use, and thus, of application effectiveness and user productivity.
