        Introduced by the CDMA Development Group (CDG) and the 3GPP2, an R-UIM card is a smart card for use with CDMA-based mobile
        phones. It enables customers to switch phones without changing their mobile numbers, stores frequently called numbers and
        provides some functions similar to the SIM card in GSM mobile phones.

    abbr :
    from : ITIL glossary (2013)
    desc : |-4
        The rack density describes the height of a unit. The standard height of one unit is 1.75 inches, so rack density is
        described in terms of the number of units, such as one unit (1U), 2U and so on. Blade servers are noted as "number of
        blades per blade chassis/height" (in standard U height), so 14 blades per blade chassis height of 7U would be listed as
        "14/7U."

    desc : |-4
        **Radio frequency identification (RFID)** refers to an automated data collection technology that uses radio frequency
        waves to transfer data between a reader and a tag to identify, track and locate the tagged item. There are two basic
        categories of tags used for logistics and transportation: passive and battery-enabled. Passive tags collect the necessary
        energy from the antenna of the reader, which can be fixed or portable. Battery-enabled tags fall into two major groupings:
        battery-assisted passive (BAP) technology and active RFID tag technology.

    term : RAID (redundant Array Of Independent Disks)
    abbr :
    from : ITIL glossary (2013)
    desc : |-4
        A method of mirroring or striping data on clusters of low-end disk drives; data is copied onto multiple drives for faster
        throughput, error correction, fault tolerance and improved mean time between failures.

        With the exception of RAID 0, all RAID levels provide automated recovery of data in the event of a disk failure. The RAID
        levels and their key features are:

        RAID-0 -- provides disk striping without parity information; data is written by segment across multiple disks sequentially
        until the end of the array is reached, and then writing starts at the beginning again. Provides greater logical disk
        capacity with faster access time on reads (multiple segments read simultaneously). However, RAID-0 provides no data
        redundancy -- if one drive fails, the entire disk array subsystem is unavailable.

        RAID-1 -- provides fault tolerance by using disk mirroring (also called shadowing). Each byte of data on a disk is
        duplicated on another physical drive, providing 100% data redundancy. RAID-1 provides immediate access to data when either
        the primary or secondary drive fails, but it has the highest cost of all RAID types, since duplicate hardware is required.

        RAID-2 -- eliminates the 100% redundancy overhead of RAID-1 by using a powerful error detection and correction code
        (Hamming), with bits of the data pattern written across multiple disks.

        RAID-3 -- similar to RAID-2, but uses a single check disk per group that contains the bit parity of the data disks; data
        is interleaved across all disks. Because disk reads are performed across the entire array and all data is transferred to
        the controller in parallel, RAID-3 is well suited for applications that require high data read/write transfer rates for
        large sequential files.

        RAID-4 -- instead of interleaving blocks of data across all drives, writes the first block on drive 1, the second block on
        drive 2, and so on. This technique dramatically improves read time, since many reads are single block (single drive),
        freeing other drives for additional read requests.

        RAID-5 -- eliminates the dedicated parity drive by writing parity with the data across all drives in the array.
        Consequently, the single-write restriction and some performance degradation of RAID-1 through RAID-4 are eliminated. If a
        drive fails, the controller can rebuild the data from the parity and data on the remaining drives.

        RAID-6 -- provides two-disk parity and one spare, so that two simultaneous disk failures per array of disks can be
        tolerated. With the occurrence of a failure, a spare is brought online and transparent reconstruction begins automatically
        in the background with negligible impact on performance.

        RAID-10 -- a combination of RAID-0 and RAID-1 that provides the benefits of striping and fault tolerance (disk mirroring).

    abbr :
    from : ITIL glossary (2013)
    desc : |-4
        A database management system (DBMS) that incorporates the relational-data model, normally including a Structured Query
        Language (SQL) application programming interface. It is a DBMS in which the database is organized and accessed according
        to the relationships between data items. In a relational database, relationships between data items are expressed by means
        of tables. Interdependencies among these tables are expressed by data values rather than by pointers. This allows a high
        degree of data independence.

        Requirements definition and management (RDM) tools streamline development teams' analysis of requirements, capture
        requirements in a database-based tool to enable collaborative review for accuracy and completeness, ease use-case and/or
        test-case creation, provide traceability, and facilitate documentation and versioning/change control. Increasingly, RDM
        tools support business analysts with graphical tools for process workflow definition, application simulation and
        prototyping, and other visual, collaborative tools. The database approach uses special-purpose repositories that are part
        of the requirements management solution or ship with a general-purpose commercial database integrated with the tool.

        The description for an operating system that responds to an external event within a short and predictable time frame.
        Unlike a batch or time-sharing operating system, a real-time operating system provides services or control to independent
        ongoing physical processes. It typically has interrupt capabilities (so that a less important task can be put aside) and a
        priority-scheduling management scheme.

        **Reconfigurable optical add/drop multiplexers (ROADMs)** are the wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) equivalent of the
        add/drop multiplexing that has been used in the Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SDH) and Synchronous Optical Network
        (SONET) markets for more than a decade. ROADMs enable communications service providers (CSPs) to automate the way
        individual wavelengths of WDM systems are routed through their networks, mainly in ring configurations, with protection
        switching and easy provisioning being the major benefits.

        **Records management (RM)** technologies enable organizations to enforce policies and rules for the retention and
        disposition of content required for documenting business transactions, in addition to automating the management of their
        record-retention policies. These technologies, implemented with well-formulated and consistently enforced RM strategies
        and policies, form an essential part of the organizationwide life cycle management of information. RM principles and
        technologies apply to both physical and electronic content.

        **Redaction tools** are software that is used to edit content and, thereby, selectively and reliably remove information
        from documents or websites before sharing the remaining content with someone who is not authorized to see the entire
        original document. The process of "redacting" documents has been used in the legal profession for decades to black out
        confidential or privileged information during the exchange of documents during litigation. The process has also been used
        by government agencies to censor sensitive material when responding to Freedom of Information Act (FoIA) requests. In the
        manual process, someone takes a paper copy of the document and uses a heavy black marker to cross out the information to
        be excluded. Redaction tools have been included as part of document imaging products since their introduction. In
        electronic documents, redaction refers to the permanent removal of information, not the masking or obfuscating of data.

    term : Relational DBMS
    abbr :
    from : ITIL glossary (2013)
    desc : |-4
        The RDBMS architecture is based on a formal method of constructing a database in rows and columns using rules that have
        formal mathematical proofs. RDBMSs originated in the work of E.F. Codd. In an RDBMS, relationships among tables are
        created by comparing data, such as account numbers and names. In addition, an RDBMS has the flexibility to take any two or
        more tables and generate a new table from the rows that meet the matching criteria.

        RDBMSs are implemented in many different ways. For example, they can be implemented on disk storage using relational or
        row storage techniques, stored as columns or indexes as in column-based storage, implemented in memory as the in-memory
        storage model, and even implemented in flash memory. In addition, RDBMS engines are available with different footprints
        that can be used as embedded DBMS engines in edge devices, as well as in portable or mobile devices. We also do not
        distinguish data types any longer because most RDBMSs available today allow multiple data types, including objects,
        user-defined data types, BLOBs and native XML structures.

        Repeatable solutions, as the basis for the portfolio of technology solutions (POTS), must be targeted at specific
        processes, technologies, subindustries or topical issues. They require high-end professional services such as business
        process re-engineering, system and network integration and software customization.

        **Revenue assurance** is the application of a process or software solution that enables a communications service provider
        (CSP) to accurately capture revenue for all services rendered. Instead of correcting errors after they occur, or not
        detecting and correcting them at all, revenue assurance enables the CSP to examine and plug dozens of actual or potential
        leakage points throughout the network and customer-facing systems, and to correct data before it reaches the billing
        system. The distinctions between revenue assurance and other disciplines are often blurred. Revenue assurance sometimes

    desc : |-4
        An RFID reader is a radio frequency device that emits a signal through an antenna. This signal is received by RFID tags
        that respond to interrogation by the reader. Responses are read by the reader, and through a variety of protocols the
        reader can communicate with all the RFID tags in its field. Readers generally take three forms. Portal readers are fixed
        in one location; RFID tags pass through them and communicate with the reader. Handheld readers are portable devices that
        can communicate with RFID tags. Mounted readers are a special type, placed on mobile equipment such as forklifts and
        cranes. They often communicate with tags in fixed locations.

    term : RFID Tags
    abbr :
    from : ITIL glossary (2013)
    desc : |-4
        **RFID tags** are generally small devices that respond to an RFID reader's interrogation via radio frequency. Tags vary in
        terms of memory, the range over which they can be read, the level of read and write capabilities, and the availability of
        other computational functions. The tag can hold just a product's serial number all the way up to a mass of information
        about the product and its history.

        Passive RFID: A passive RFID tag has no battery. It harvests all its power from the radio interrogation of the RFID
        reader, including enough power to respond. This yields fairly low-cost devices, but they can be read only at a fairly
        short range (about 20 feet in the best operating conditions).

        Active RFID: Active tags have batteries attached to them so that they can respond to a reader with more power. They are
        much more expensive than passive tags but have a much-greater range (up to 300 feet).

        Smart Cards: Contactless smart cards are often referred to as RFID tags. From a technical perspective, they are just a
        specially packaged form of RFID tags.

        Sensors: RFID tags don't tell you anything about their environment. They can only tell you what is in the memory of the
        tag. However, a common application of RFID is to attach the tag to a sensor that can fill the tag's memory with data. This
        is then communicated to other systems through RFID protocols. The sensory technology, while intertwined with RFID, is
        independent.

        preparation or compile time. By using less hardware or logic, the system can operate at higher speeds. RISC cuts down on
        the number and complexity of instructions, on the theory that each one can be accessed and executed faster, and that less
        semiconductor real estate is required to process them. The result is that for any given semiconductor technology, a more
        powerful microprocessor can be produced with RISC than with complex instruction set computer (CISC) architectures.

        This simplification of computer instruction sets gains processing efficiencies. That theme works because all computers and
        programs execute mostly simple instructions. RISC has five design principles:

        -   Single-cycle execution -- In most traditional central processing unit (CPU) designs, the peak possible execution rate
            is one instruction per basic machine cycle, and for a given technology, the cycle time has some fixed lower limit.
            Even on complex CPUs, most compiler-generated instructions are simple. RISC designs emphasize single-cycle execution,
            even at the expense of synthesizing multi-instruction sequences for some less-frequent operations.

        -   Hard-wired control, little or no microcode -- Microcode adds a layer of interpretive overhead, raising the number of
            cycles per instruction, so even the simplest instructions can require several cycles.

        -   Simple instructions, few addressing modes -- Complex instructions and addressing modes, which entail microcode or
            multicycle instructions, are avoided.

        -   Load and store, register-register design -- Only loads and stores access memory; all others perform register-register
            operations. This tends to follow from the previous three principles.

        -   Efficient, deep pipelining -- To make convenient use of hardware parallelism without the complexities of horizontal
            microcode, fast CPUs use pipelining. An n-stage pipeline keeps up to "n" instructions active at once, ideally
            finishing one (and starting another) every cycle. The instruction set must be carefully tuned to support pipelining.

        Gartner defines **risk management and compliance consulting services** as the bundle of expert-driven consulting services
        directed at assisting enterprises to identify, manage and mitigate IT and enterprise compliance risk. Although there are
        myriad types of risk and compliance in the life of an enterprise, we focus on risk and compliance advisory services
        directly affecting or influencing IT.

    term : RM (relationship Manager)
    abbr :
    from : ITIL glossary (2013)
    desc : |-4
        A staff member who acts as an organizational liaison, typically between an information services (IS) department and
        business-unit or function. The relationship manager may fulfill a combination of roles that correspond to the degree of
        trust and authority granted to the person in that role by his/her customer. The job content of the position (in order of
        increasing business trust and responsibility) is classified in four levels:

        Level 1: Inform and Communicate

        Level 2: Advise and Influence

        Level 3: Coordinate and Integrate

        Level 4: Manage and Oversee

        Relationship management is essentially a matrixed position, with reporting requirements to at least two managers
        (typically a chief information officer -- CIO -- and business function or division manager). In practice, however, the
        position is usually linked more strongly to one side than another, and is most often aligned to the business management
        side.

    desc : |-4
        Ability of a mobile user to access cellular services while away from the home network. This includes automated roaming
        between GSM networks, SIM-based roaming, where a user switches the SIM card into a mobile phone from a different network,
        or roaming across technologies (for example, between a WCDMA network and the GSM network of another operator). Roaming can
        take place within one country and across national boundaries. In a WLAN context, roaming occurs when a mobile device
        disassociates from one access point and then re-associates with a new access point.

    desc : |-4
        A nomenclature and philosophy that goes beyond the traditional return on investment (ROI) concept by focusing the metric
        or calculation on how competitiveness is affected by investment. A good way to visualize and quantify the overall return
        on IT competitiveness is to build a spider diagram that identifies and maps all the relevant dimensions of competitiveness
        within a given industry sector, and then measure the changes in the overall mapping area during a given time interval
        (e.g., a year).

    term : Rotary Heat Exchanger (Kyoto Wheel)
    abbr :
    from : ITIL glossary (2013)
    desc : |-4
        The **rotary heat exchanger** (also known as a **Kyoto Wheel** ) is a form of air-side economizer that solves some of the
        problems associated with air-side economizers. Instead of introducing exterior air directly into the server room, the heat
        wheel transfers heat between separated data center ducts and outside air ducts. The heat wheel is bisected by two parallel
        ducts. Outside air flows across the top half of the wheel, while inside air flows across the bottom half. The wheel itself
        is a big honeycomb. A cold honeycomb cell enters the hot duct at 0 degrees of angle. The inside air warms the cell (and
        the wheel) as it rotates through the duct, until, at the 180-degree mark, the cell is hot at the front and cool at the
        back, effectively cooling the air passing over it. The now-warm cell rotates into the outside air duct, where it is cooled
        through a half-rotation. Then, the cool cell enters the warm side, and the cycle begins again.The Kyoto Wheel ranges
        between 12 and 20 feet in diameter. Rotation is slow--just a few revolutions per minute (rpm)--to optimize the heat
        transfer. In this design, there is minimal air transfer between the outside air and the computer room air (new designs
        reduce air transfer to 1% or less), eliminating the humidity and particulate contamination problems associated with
        direct-transfer, air-side economizers.
