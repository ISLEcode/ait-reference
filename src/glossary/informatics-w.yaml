    abbr :
    from : ITIL glossary (2013)
    desc : |-4
        UMTS standard for 3G digital mobile networks, using CDMA technology. It is the evolution path for GSM and EDGE to UMTS and
        offers increased voice capacity and theoretical peak data speeds of up to 2 Mbps. The 3GPP task group continues to work on
        the evolution of WCDMA toward 4G and has defined a series of evolutionary steps:

        -   R.99 (Release 99) -- Specifications (completed in 1999) for the original version of WCDMA, a 3GPP standards project to
            define the requirements and basic framework for UMTS 3G mobile networks. R.99 defined the UTRA and the basic features
            of this early 3G development.

        -   R.4 (Release 4) -- Specifications (released in 2004) for the next evolution beyond R99. R4 was the first step toward
            an all-IP core network, adding separation of the control channel from the connection in the circuit-switched core
            network, and basic VoIP routing.

        -   R.5 (Release 5) -- Specifications (released in 2005) for the next evolution beyond R4. R.5 extends WCDMA to include
            HSDPA and HSUPA for high-speed packet data services and IMS for multimedia and converged IP network support. It added
            IP transport in the UTRAN.

        -   R.6 (Release 6) -- Specifications (completed in 2006) for the next evolution beyond R5. R.6 extends WCDMA to include
            MBMS for mobile TV services, PoC and EUDCH for enhanced uplink speeds and system capacity. R.6 adds IMS Phase 2 and
            UMTS/WLAN interworking.

        -   R.7 (Release 7) -- Also known as LTE, the specifications (frozen at the end of 2007) for the next evolution beyond
            R.6. It will add radio enhancements, MIMO, end-to-end IP telephony and evolved EDGE. See also LTE.

        -   R.8 (Release -- Further extension of LTE and SAE capabilities prior to the advent of 4G. R.8 is likely to add OFDMA
            for the downlink and SC-FDMA for the uplink in the UTRAN. R8 specifications were frozen in December 2008. See also LTE
            and SAE.

    desc : |-4
        a software concept and infrastructure -- supported by several major computing vendors (notably Microsoft and IBM) -- for
        program-to-program communication and application component delivery. The Web services concept treats software as a set of
        services accessible over ubiquitous networks using Web-based standards and protocols.

        Specifically, a Web service is a software component can be accessed by another application (such as a client, a server or
        another Web service) through the use of generally available, ubiquitous protocols and transports, such as Hypertext
        Transport Protocol (HTTP). Joint efforts between IBM and Microsoft, with the support of other vendors such as Ariba and
        Iona Technologies, have produced agreement on a basic set of XML-based standards for Web service interface definition,
        discovery and remote calling. They include:

        -   Web Services Description Language (WSDL) for describing Web service interfaces

        -   Universal Description, Discovery and Integration (UDDI) as the means for users to publish and locate available Web
            services, their characteristics and interfaces

        -   Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP), which enables an application to call a Web service

        a security solution developed as a migration step toward 802.11i. Wi-Fi vendors introduced WPA in late 2002, before
        802.11i was ratified. WPA formalized the choice for encryption but left open the choice of authentication. WPA was used as
        an improvement over the vulnerable WEP but was superseded by WPA2.

        and SK Telecom. WiBro was originally intended as a South Korean standard, but it has been harmonized with the IEEE
        802.16-2005 mobile WiMAX standard. WiBro emerged from a South Korean MIC-sponsored project to develop a standard for
        high-speed portable Internet (HPi). The former MIC had hoped that HPi would lead to new global opportunities for South
        Korean industry, similar to those arising from its early adoption of CDMA.
