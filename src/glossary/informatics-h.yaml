    desc : |-4
        Process of transferring a mobile telephone call from one cell to another without dropping the call. Cellular users may
        traverse several cells during a conversation, sometimes requiring a high-speed handoff in a moving vehicle. A soft handoff
        entails establishing a second radio link with the mobile device before the first link is severed.

        **Handwriting recognition** systems use pattern matching to convert handwritten letters into corresponding computer text
        or commands in real time. Batch recognition of handwritten forms is already embedded into mainstream form sorting and
        processing systems (for example, for mail and check handling, and other types of financial applications and transactions),
        and it is not included in this analysis. Digital pens also use handwriting recognition and are covered in a separate
        technology analysis.

        **Haptics** use tactile interfaces (for example, steering wheels and seats) to provide touch or force feedback as part of
        the user interface (UI) in vehicles (for example, a vibrating seat to inform driver of a pedestrian about to cross the
        street). Haptic technology has the potential to add new forms of driver communication to a vehicle, and to improve the
        overall usability of vehicles and their information applications.

        **Haptics** is a tactile or force-feedback technology that leverages a person's sense of touch by applying vibrations
        and/or motion to the user's fingertips. This stimulation can assist the technology in the development of virtual objects
        on the device screen. In its broad sense, haptics can be any system that incorporates tactile feedback and vibrates
        through a sense of touch.

        Maintenance services include both hardware maintenance and support services, and network software maintenance and support
        services.

        Hardware maintenance and support services are preventive and remedial services that physically repair or optimize
        hardware, including contract maintenance and per-incident repair. Hardware support also includes online and telephone
        technical troubleshooting and assistance for setup, and all fee-based hardware warranty upgrades.

        Sales of all parts are also included, exclusive of parts bundled with maintenance contracts. This segment includes only
        external customer spending on these services.

        Software maintenance and support services include long-term and pay-as-you-go (incident-based) support contracts. Software
        support contracts include remote troubleshooting and support provided via the telephone and online channels, as well as
        installation assistance and basic usability assistance. In some cases, software support services may include new product
        installation services, installation of product updates, migrations for major releases of software and other types of
        proactive or reactive on-site services. Software products and technologies covered under this category include operating
        systems and infrastructure software. Software support services do not include the purchase of subscriptions that provide
        entitlement and rights to use future minor versions (point releases) or future major releases of software.

    desc : |-4
        **Head-mounted displays (HMDs)** are small displays or projection technology integrated into eyeglasses or mounted on a
        helmet or hat. Heads-up displays are a type of HMD that does not block the user's vision, but superimposes the image on
        the user's view of the real world. An emerging form of heads-up display is a retinal display that "paints" a picture
        directly on the sensitive part of the user's retina. Although the image appears to be on a screen at the user's ideal
        viewing distance, there is no actual screen in front of the user, just special optics (for example, modified eyeglasses)
        that reflect the image back into the eye. Other heads-up displays that are not worn by the user but are projected on a
        surface (for example, on a car or plane windshield) are not covered in this discussion. Some HMDs incorporate motion
        sensors to determine direction and movement (for example, to provide context-sensitive geographic information) or as the
        interface to an immersive virtual reality application.

    desc : |-4
        A **health information exchange (HIE)** is a regional collaboration among independent healthcare organizations for sharing
        clinical information. Often, administrative information is shared as well. HIEs may be categorized in terms of their
        approach to governance. In some countries, they may be run by a governmental agency. Other HIEs may be run by nonprofit
        corporations with a board of governors that represent community stakeholders. Still others are lines of business of
        for-profit vendors. A final form of HIE is funded and controlled by healthcare delivery organizations (HDOs) to meet their
        own business concerns, rather than being neutral to all community stakeholders.

    term : Heterogeneous Architecture
    abbr :
    from : ITIL glossary (2013)
    desc : |-4
        A **heterogeneous architecture** is a computing system architecture in which processors use more than one instruction set,
        all of which share a single memory. This requires programs to be written differently for each of the dissimilar
        instruction sets. The goal is to offer substantially better performance or cost by devoting the appropriate parts of the
        application to machine designs optimized for specific types of computing.

    abbr :
    from : ITIL glossary (2013)
    desc : |-4
        **High-definition (HD) voice** is also known as wideband voice. Compared to traditional telephony voice over public
        switched telephone networks (PSTNs) and cellular, HD voice uses double the sampling rate, reproducing a much larger sound
        frequency and delivering all, or most, of the frequencies of a user's voice. HD voice's major advantage is the ability to
        communicate with clearer audio and have improved and more intelligible conversations over fixed line, cellular networks
        and voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP).

    abbr :
    from : ITIL glossary (2013)
    desc : |-4
        HPC clusters can be composed of large numbers of servers, where the total physical size, energy use or heat output of the
        computing cluster might become a serious issue. Furthermore, there are requirements for dedicated communications among the
        servers that are somewhat unique to clusters. Because small design differences amount to large benefits when multiplied by
        the number of servers in the clusters, we are seeing the emergence of server designs that are optimized for HPC. Sometimes
        these are designs targeted at large, public Web operators, such as search engine firms, that deliver similar benefits in
        HPC clusters, but they can also offer features only appropriate for HPC users. For example, if the system were designed to
        provide the cluster interconnect differently, there might be a significant cabling reductions possible.

        Gartner defines a *high performance workplace* as a physical or virtual environment designed to make workers as effective
        as possible in supporting business goals and providing value. A high-performance workplace results from continually
        balancing investment in people, process, physical environment and technology, to measurably enhance the ability of workers
        to learn, discover, innovate, team and lead, and to achieve efficiency and financial benefit.

    desc : |-4
        technology that facilitates the use of ceramic materials for conducting and transmitting electricity with little or no
        resistance loss without the need to achieve low-temperature superconductivity. Despite its name, high-temperature
        superconductivity still occurs at cryogenic temperatures. The main difference from low-temperature superconductivity,
        which is usually achieved at or near the absolute zero temperature (minus 273 degrees Celsius), is that high-temperature
        superconductors (HTSs) can use liquid nitrogen (at minus 196 degrees Celsius) as a coolant.

    desc : |-4
        refers to the silicon temperature at a transistor junction of the processor used in a server. Typically, the maximum
        operating temperature is specified as 85 degrees Celsius. This temperature is the balance between the power consumed by
        the processor and the rate at which the processor is cooled. Increasing the maximum temperature to 105 degrees Celsius
        allows the environmental temperature to be increased by 20 degrees. Such an increase can eliminate the need for chillers
        in many environments, increasing the potential for using free cooling, and decreasing the cooling costs.There is, however,
        a downside. At the increased operating temperature, the processor must run at a somewhat slower maximum clock speed.
        Reliability also decreases by a small amount, and unit costs increase. On the other hand, heat sinks can be smaller,
        increasing server density.

        a two-color printing scheme found in some transactional documents, such as bills and statements. Black is the first color.
        The second color is used for emphasis or to highlight important information, such as the due date. The second color can
        also be used to match the corporate color scheme, in which the company name, logo or other elements are printed. Gartner
        classifies highlight color devices as "monochrome" in the market data and forecast estimates it publishes.

    desc : |-4
        A document-formatting language derived from the Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML), predominately used to create
        Web pages. The user's browser interprets HTML commands and formats the page layout, fonts and graphics on the screen. One
        of the more powerful features of HTML is its ability to create hyperlinks that enable the user to navigate between
        documents and files with a single click. HTTP is also sometimes used for messaging attachments as a way of supporting rich
        text formatting across product boundaries.

        HTML that is generated by a program or service is considered "dynamically generated HTML," which has been confused with
        the Netscape and Microsoft technology called dynamic HTML (DHTML). These technologies offer client-side mechanisms for
        enhancing the capabilities of the Web browser and HTML documents. Dynamically generated HTML might contain DHTML, but they

        **Humanitarian disaster relief** is a complex set of tools and processes that government agencies use to obtain and
        maintain authority and control, manage disparate resources and address the many needs of victims during a disaster.
        Complexity is inherent in the process because many organizations with expert disaster relief skills, emergency responders
        and volunteers are present at the disaster location and need to be managed; many have no official interface to the
        authorities or specific deployment instructions, making their responses chaotic.

        WAN technologies, commonly carrier MPLS networks and IPsec virtual private networks (VPNs) over Internet infrastructure,
        in a consolidated enterprise WAN. While Internet-based VPNs are commonly used for smaller offices, and MPLS tends to be
        the basis of major corporate network backbones and larger offices, this approach uses both network types at a specific

    term : Hybrid Storage Gateway Appliance
    abbr :
    from : ITIL glossary (2013)
    desc : |-4
        A **hybrid storage appliance** is a physical or virtual storage caching system that destages local or on-site data storage
        to the cloud instead of to back-end disks. In every other way, it behaves as a storage system. The term "hybrid" describes
        the fact that the appliance combines local storage with cloud storage, usually public cloud storage that is geographically
        distant from the appliance. From a data flow perspective, it is a storage target or an in-band appliance that intercepts
        all input/outputs (I/Os) to and from a virtual volume or file system. From a storage system perspective, it uses
        sophisticated cache management algorithms to minimize data flows to and from the cloud by satisfying as many I/Os as
        possible from local storage. Data is compressed or deduplicated in the appliance to increase its effective cache capacity,
        and when data is actually transferred to or from the cloud, WAN-optimized controller (WOC) techniques are often used to
        reduce the impact of link latency on performance.
