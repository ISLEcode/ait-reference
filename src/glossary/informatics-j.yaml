    term : Java Applet
    abbr :
    from : ITIL glossary (2013)
    desc : |-4
        A small piece of Java code that implements a specific function. Applets may run on a server or be downloaded and run on
        the client's machine.

    term : Java ME (Java Platform, Micro Edition)
    abbr :
    from : ITIL glossary (2013)
    desc : |-4
        Reduced-feature version of Java defined by Sun Microsystems for use in mobile devices, such as mobile phones. Java ME
        (formerly known as Java 2ME) is part of a set of related Java technologies that includes definitions of profiles and
        configurations.

        The Java platform AD tool market includes tools used to construct applications that operate within Java Community Process
        (JCP)-certified and JCP-compliant Java runtimes. These tools may include code-centric integrated development environments,
        or they may employ more-advanced features, such as model-driven code generators or other architected rapid AD features.

        **Java Platform, Enterprise Edition (Java EE)** is a Java Community Process (JCP)-managed architecture and programming
        model for multiplatform Java business applications. Java EE is implemented as Java EE application servers by many
        commercial and some open-source, community-style vendors.

    term : Java Servlet
    abbr :
    from : ITIL glossary (2013)
    desc : |-4
        A Java program that operates in conjunction with a Web server, and can output Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) to a
        browser or even communicate with Java applets. Servlets offer an alternative to using Common Gateway Interface (CGI) and
        server application programming interfaces (SAPIs) to communicate with Web server processes.

        The term "Java" can be applied to Sun's Java platform or to its Java programming language. The Java platform is made up of
        a set of technologies that provide cross-platform, network-centric computing solutions. The programming language is simply
        one aspect of the Java platform. The elements of the Java platform include the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), which provides
        a uniform Java byte code emulator for Java's cross-platform runtime environment; the Java programming language, which
        provides a robust, object-oriented language for constructing Java components and applications; and the standard Java-class
        library packages, which provide sets of reusable services that promote consistency among components and applications.

        The Java programming language is based on C and extends and complements the basic capabilities of HTML. Java permits the
        creation of applications and application modules (called "applets") that run in the JVM on the browser. Browsers from
        Netscape and Microsoft have a JVM. Java's platform independence and security are designed in, rather than added on, so
        applications can run on a wide variety of desktop platforms as long as they can run a Java-enabled browser.

    term : JavaScript
    abbr :
    from : ITIL glossary (2013)
    desc : |-4
        A scripting language targeted specifically to the Internet. It is the first scripting language to fully conform to
        ECMAScript, the Web's only standard scripting language. Despite its name, JavaScript is not a derivative of Java; its
        origin is Netscape's Livescript language. JavaScript is, in fact, closer to C/C++ in syntax than it is to Java.

    term : Jidoka
    abbr :
    from : ITIL glossary (2013)
    desc : |-4
        Automatic inspection such that defects can be prevented from moving further along in the production process.

    term : JIT (just In Time)
    abbr :
    from : ITIL glossary (2013)
    desc : |-4
        An approach of sequencing the arrival of material to a work center just prior to consumption to avoid large
        work-in-process inventories.

    term : Job Scheduling
    abbr :
    from : ITIL glossary (2013)
    desc : |-4
        Job scheduling tools supervise a logical process (several jobs or programs) as they execute in a mainframe or distributed
        environment, providing scheduling and dependency management of the process as it runs, mainly in sequence, across
        disparate systems, geographies and applications. The tools in this category are used for "batch integration" of
        heterogeneous applications and data stores.

    term : Jukebox
    abbr :
    from : ITIL glossary (2013)
    desc : |-4
        An automatic media handler for an optical disk drive, also called a library. An optical jukebox is designed to move
        optical platters in and out of optical drives. The intent is to provide a large amount of easily accessed storage in a
        "near-line" fashion. Jukeboxes use robotics. Similar in concept to music jukeboxes, the robot arm locates the appropriate
        disk and, if it is not already mounted in a drive, clears the drive and loads the selected disk.
