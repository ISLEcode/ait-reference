    desc : |-4
        Also known as HTTPS, this is an extension of Hypertext Transport Protocol (HTTP) that provides security services for
        transaction confidentiality, authenticity and integrity between HTTP servers and clients. For the purposes of Internet
        browsers, S-HTTP is a competitive alternative to the more widely used Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) standard. S-HTTP was
        designed for use in browser applications, so it cannot be used to secure non-browser-based Internet applications.

    desc : |-4
        **Sales-focused partner relationship management (PRM)** applications are designed to improve an enterprise's ability to
        market, sell and service end customers through channel partners. This category includes many of the traditional elements
        contained in a direct sales solution (opportunity management), but the solutions are configured for supporting a
        partner-driven environment. These applications consolidate data and transactions; set business rules and track activity;
        are typically used to manage channel partners, distributors, alliance or strategic partnerships; and often include a
        portal to enable bidirectional information flow and communications between partners.

    term : SAM Tools (systems Administration Management Tools)
    abbr :
    from : ITIL glossary (2013)
    desc : |-4
        A flexible set of application maintenance utilities and application administration tools. The key value of such tools is
        derived from how well they manage changes. A well-designed tool permits an administrator to describe either a database or
        a form field change, ensures the integrity of all of the application components tied to the change and propagates the
        change to all affected users. SAM tools for central administration are used by system administrators and thus provide a
        level of technical competency, whereas administrative functionality for managers (e.g., sales managers, marketing content
        managers and call center supervisors) must be limited by the capabilities of the end user.

    term : SDH/SONET
    abbr :
    from : ITIL glossary (2013)
    desc : |-4
        SDH/SONET technology differs by region. SONET is sold only in North America. SDH is sold outside North America and comes
        in two types: SDH (Japan) is sold only in Japan, while SDH (ETSI) is sold in the rest of the world. SDH/SONET supports
        ring and mesh topologies, and protection of circuits through automatic protection switching (APS) is standard, via various
        protection programs.

        SDH/SONET comes in standardized bit rates, with SDH circuits referred to as synchronous transfer mode (STM)-x (where x =
        1, 4, 16, 64 and 256) connections and SONET circuits known as Optical Carrier Rate (OC)-n (where n = 3, 12, 48, 192, 768)
        connections. The standardized bit rates are:

        STM-1/OC-3 (155 Mbps).

        STM-4/OC-12 (622 Mbps).

        STM-16/OC-48 (2.5 Gbps).

        STM-64/OC-192 (10 Gbps).

        STM-256/OC-768 (40 Gbps).

        Originally, the SDH/SONET standards were defined as a rigid hierarchy optimized specifically to handle circuit-based voice
        traffic. With the requirement to support data services becoming more evident, additions were made to the SDH/SONET
        standards to allow for more flexible traffic handling, especially with regard to data services in general and Ethernet
        services in particular. New features such as the Generic Framing Procedure (GFP) and LCAS were added to the standards, as
        well as support for increased control plane functionality as defined in the standards for Automatic Switched Transport
        Network (ASTN)/Automatic Switched Optical Network (ASON).

        In addition, vendors have added cross-connect functionality to SDH/SONET equipment to support add/drop functionality.
        Also, convergence between SDH/SONET and WDM products has become the norm in the optical transport market.

    term : SDMA (spatial Division Multiple Access)
    abbr :
    from : ITIL glossary (2013)
    desc : |-4
        Advanced multiple antenna technique that increases the spectral efficiency, range and bandwidth available to moving
        wireless devices. Traditional cellular base stations radiate power in all directions, because they have no information
        about where the mobile device is located. This wastes power and causes interference to adjacent cells, as well as making
        it harder to distinguish weaker incoming signals from among the noise and interference. By using smart antenna technology
        to track the spatial location of mobile devices, the radiation pattern of the base station can be adjusted to optimize
        both transmission and reception for each user device. By rapidly adjusting the phase of signals from several antennas, the
        base station can effectively steer a beam or a spot of RF power to or from each user. Unlike MIMO, only one antenna is
        required at the client device, potentially reducing customer premises equipment (CPE) costs. SDMA techniques are used in
        proprietary wireless broadband systems and are likely options for mobile WiMAX and LTE. See also smart antenna.

        **Search-based data discovery tools** enable users to develop and refine views and analyses of structured and unstructured
        data using search terms. Like visualization-based data discovery tools, they have three attributes: (1) a proprietary data
        structure to store and model data gathered from disparate sources, which minimizes reliance on predefined business
        intelligence (BI) metadata; (2) a built-in performance layer using RAM or indexing that lessens the need for aggregates,
        summaries and pre-calculations; and (3) an intuitive interface, enabling users to explore data without much training.
        However, as well as having a broader scope (visualization-driven data discovery tools focus exclusively on quantitative
        data) they differ at the user interface layer, with search-based data discovery tools using text search input and results
        to guide users to the information they need.

        Previously owned or used mobile devices that are sold or given free to other users who typically obtain a new network
        connection. Secondhand devices sometimes are refurbished systematically before resale in other countries or passed on to
        other users in their original condition. Although most countries have a small secondhand market, it is a significant
        factor in price-sensitive developing markets such as China, where marginal subscribers are looking for the lowest-cost,

    term : Secret-key Cryptography
    abbr :
    from : ITIL glossary (2013)
    desc : |-4
        In this cryptography method (also known as symmetric-key cryptography), the single key needed to encrypt and decrypt
        messages is a shared secret between the communicating parties. The biggest problem with this method is that the secret key

        processes for purposes of individually or selectively sourcing each component separately and distinctly. The main business
        driver is to determine the best risk-reward combination for each individual scope of work. Most often, this is done to
        allow for extensive competition to achieve the highest-quality performance at the best price point. The overall role of
        overseeing (program management) and managing the delivery, risk and overall legal compliance across the entire scope of
        services across all the individual components lies with the internal IT organization.

        Server virtualization infrastructure includes the hypervisor, VM and virtual machine monitors (VMMs). The key to
        "virtualizing" a server is the hypervisor. A hypervisor is a layer of software (the term "software" can mean preloaded
        software that runs in a protected area or microcode/firmware, depending on the implementation) that runs directly on
        hardware and allows the definition of fixed partitions with predefined priorities for accessing hardware resources. These
        partitions are incomplete VMs because they prioritize, but do not share, all hardware resources. To support flexible
        configuration, a hypervisor in general is implemented with a VMM. The VMM virtualizes all hardware needed for VMs to run.
        Most products currently labeled hypervisors bundle a VMM.

        virtualization-oriented lineage. In addition, hypervisor vendors are providing additional management tooling on top of

        SBCs connect IP networks (enterprise to service provider) and introduce new edge requirements in three major areas:
        security, service assurance and law enforcement. SBCs sit at the edge of the service provider's network and complement
        established routers with their ability to perform required control functions by integrating session signaling and media
        control. SBCs operate as SIP back-to-back user agents, MGCP proxy/network-address translations (NATs) and/or H.323
        back-to-back gateways. They are both the source and the destination of all signaling messages and media streams entering
        and leaving the provider's network.

        The SBC space has been largely cornered by startup vendors, but other equipment vendors have taken two approaches: they
        have partnered with the SBC vendors or embedded SBC functionality into some of their existing solutions, such as routers.
        Gartner recognizes that there are some embedded solutions with SBC function, but counts only those that are stand-alone.

        faces different IT challenges--than do large enterprises, and whose IT resources (usually budget and staff) are often
        highly constrained. For the purposes of its research, Gartner defines SMBs by the number of employees and annual revenue
        they have. The attribute used most often is number of employees; small businesses are usually defined as organizations
        with fewer than 100 employees; midsize enterprises are those organizations with 100 to 999 employees. The second most
        popular attribute used to define the SMB market is annual revenue: small business is usually defined as organizations with
        less than \$50 million in annual revenue; midsize enterprise is defined as organizations that make more than \$50 million,

        of the technical nature of the task, an SOC must have information systems (IS) representation. An SOC should meet on a
        regular basis to review all current and planned medical software implementations. In addition, it should form, and
        possibly enforce, a policy designed to ensure patient safety where medical software is concerned. Specific SOC
        responsibilities include validating that applications perform reliably and as expected, for example, by creating and
        running trial scenarios looking at both system and clinical functionality. A SOC should ensure that all decision support
        applications are based on accurate data, that they are implemented correctly and that the rule base is kept current. It
        should also examine how the various packages operate in tandem, paying close attention to combinations of functions that
        could potentially lead to errors that place patients at risk.

        **Social network analysis (SNA)** tools are used to analyze patterns of relationships among people in groups. They are
        useful for examining the social structure and interdependencies (or work patterns) of individuals or organizations. SNA
        involves collecting data from multiple sources (such as surveys, emails, blogs and other electronic artifacts), analyzing
        the data to identify relationships, and mining it for new information--such as the quality or effectiveness of a
        relationship. Organizational network analysis is the form of SNA that examines the information flow among individuals. It
        depicts the informal social network--typically of groups working in the same enterprise. Value network analysis (VNA)
        examines the deliverables exchanged among roles--typically groups of people from multiple organizations that need to work
        together. Social influence network analysis scans social media to identify influential people, associations or trends in

        Softswitch architecture comprises softswitches/MGCs, VoIP gateways and application servers. These are among the terms used
        to identify the major network elements of softswitch architecture. For our purposes, the terms "softswitch" and
        "softswitch architecture" refer to the softswitch/VoIP gateway/application server approach to distributed switching
        technology.

        Softswitches for cable networks are essentially the same as those used by traditional telephone companies, but they must
        comply with the NG standards from Cable Television Laboratories (CableLabs) for packetized voice-over-cable networks.

        Softswitch architectures are mostly being deployed in traditional operators' core networks for wireline or mobile
        trunking, and in the networks of long-distance service providers. Many voice-over-broadband networks are based on Class 5
        architecture to provision Class 5 services, as well as calling card services using VoIP technology. In mobile networks,
        deployment of mobile softswitches in the radio access network (RAN) is limited by the slow deployment of third-generation
        (3G) infrastructure and the highly optimized TDM architecture in the RAN.

        With the migration to SIP, softswitch architecture lends itself to the 3GPP and ETSI TISPAN standards to develop
        IMS-compliant applications.

        To provide services without a physical switch, a softswitch is connected to a server (a Sun Microsystems or Unix machine,
        for instance) that runs the application. A softswitch is also connected to a media gateway, which is the element that
        physically connects to the PSTN, IP network or ATM network.

        A softswitch is also known as a call agent, a call server or an MGC. It is a device that provides the traditional call
        control functions or switching matrix of a Class 4 and Class 5 switch. In a mobile network, a softswitch is also called a
        mobile switching center (MSC). At minimum, a softswitch provides:

        Intelligence that controls connection services for a media gateway or native IP endpoint.

        The ability to select processes that can be applied to a call.

        Routing for a call in the network, based on signaling and customer database information.

        The ability to transfer control of a call to another network element.

        Interfaces to, and support for, management functions, such as provisioning fault-tolerant billing.

        Support for multiple protocols, including some subsets of MGCP, Media Gateway Control Protocol (Megaco), SIP, SS7, call
        processing language, H.323 and Q.931/Q.2931.

        definition, data manipulation and data control. It is a programmed interface to relational database management systems
        (RDBMSs). IBM introduced SQL as the main external interface to its experimental RDBMS, System R, which it developed in the
        1970s. SQL statements include:

        Data manipulation language statements: SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE

        Data definition language statements, including the CREATE and DROP statements for tables and indexes

        Statements that control data consistency, and grant and revoke authority

        SQL statements are called "dynamic" when they are not completely specified until the program is executed. They are called
        "static" when they are completely specified when the program is compiled. SQL is precise, because it is based on predicate
        logic, but is difficult for average users to deal with, and its most fruitful position is as a protocol for
        software-to-software connectivity, rather than for human-to-software access.

    abbr :

    desc : |-4
        A framework for creating documents that requires four core mechanisms for defining the structure, scripting, populating
        (filling) and output channels of documents.

        1.Structure definition consists of tools to define components (e.g., title, author, introduction, conclusion) and their
        sequence (e.g., "introductions" precede "conclusions"). The defined sequence cannot be modified or removed through
        editing.

        2.Scripting is procedural logic that defines how to derive (i.e., calculate) content, and how to access or create queries
        that test and conditionally incorporate content from external sources (e.g., databases), other applications and content
        repositories.

        3.Populating executes scripts against the structural definition to create an instance of the content model expressed in
        the document definition. This includes executing data and content retrieval, queries and computations to generate a
        fleshed-out document (an "instance") from the document skeleton defined by the structural and scripting elements.

        4.Output channels control the content so that the same content can be formatted and composed for multiple media, such as
        print, Web or CD-ROM delivery.

        encoder (which converts the audio or video source to a data stream), a streaming server that delivers the encoded media
        over a network, and a client media player that cooperates with the server to deliver uninterrupted media. To compensate

        A mobile OS originally derived from Psion's EPOC. Up until 2009 Symbian was developed by an independent company jointly
        owned by Nokia, Ericsson, Sony Ericsson, Panasonic, Siemens and Samsung, which licensed the platform to mobile handset
        manufacturers. In 2009 Nokia bought out the other owners and converted Symbian into an open source foundation. From 2010,
        Symbian will be run as an open source project managed by the Symbian Foundation, the governing body for open source
        Symbian.

    term : Synchronous Transmission
    abbr :
    from : ITIL glossary (2013)
    desc : |-4
        Timing is achieved by transmitting sync characters prior to data. It does not use such redundant information as the start
        and stop bits in asynchronous transmission to identify the beginning and end of characters and is thus faster and more
        efficient.

  - uuid : udx8av6tbc
    term : Synchronous
    abbr :
    from : ITIL glossary (2013)
    desc : |-4
        Having a constant time interval between successive bits, characters or events. Synchronous transmission uses no redundant
        information to identify the beginning and end of characters, and is faster and more efficient than asynchronous
        transmission, which uses start and stop bits. The timing is achieved by transmitting sync characters prior to data;
        usually synchronization can be achieved in two-or three-character times.
