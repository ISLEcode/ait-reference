        A report similar to the [annual report](glossary://investment/annual-report), except that it contains more detailed information about the companyâ€™s business, finances, and management.

All publicly [trade](glossary://investment/trade)companies are required to file a 10-K report each year to the [SEC](glossary://investment/SEC).

A genuine [no-load fund](glossary://investment/no-load-fund) does not have [12b-1 fees](glossary://investment/12b-1-fees), although some funds calling themselves &amp;quot;no-load&amp;quot; do have 12b-1 fees (as do some [load funds](glossary://investment/load-funds)). 12b-1 fee information is [disclosed](glossary://investment/disclosed) in a fund's [prospectus](glossary://investment/prospectus), is included in the stated expense ratio, and is usually less than 1%.

        A [stock](glossary://investment/stock) that was listed on one of the national [securities](glossary://investment/securities) exchanges, such as the [NYSE](glossary://investment/NYSE), after April 26, 1979, absolving it from rule 19c3 which forbids exchange members from participating in off-board trading.

  - name: 30-day wash rule
    desc: |-4
        [IRS](glossary://investment/IRS) rule prohibiting a [tax](glossary://investment/tax)payer from claiming a loss on the sale of an [investment](glossary://investment/investment) if that same investment was purchased within 30 days before or after the sale date.

  - name: 401(k) plan
    also: SIMPLE 401(k) Plan
    desc: |-4
        A defined [contribution](glossary://investment/contribution) plan offered by a corporation to its employees, which allows employees to set aside [tax-deferred](glossary://investment/tax-deferred) income for [retirement](glossary://investment/retirement) purposes, and in some cases employers will match their contribution dollar-for-dollar. Taking a distribution of the funds before a certain specified age will trigger a penalty [tax](glossary://investment/tax).

There are several advantages to 403(b) plans: [contributions](glossary://investment/contributions) lower taxable income, larger [contributions](glossary://investment/contributions) can be made to the account, earnings can grow [tax-deferred](glossary://investment/tax-deferred), and some plans allow [loans](glossary://investment/loans). Contributions can grow tax-deferred until withdrawal at which time the money is taxed as [ordinary income](glossary://investment/ordinary-income) (which is sometimes a disadvantage).

  - name: 408(k) plan
    also: Salary Reduction Simplified Employee Pension Plan
    desc: |-4
        A simpler alternative to a [401(k) plan](glossary://investment/401(k) plan) available only to companies with 25 or fewer employees, which gives employees the opportunity to make [contributions](glossary://investment/contributions) to their [SEP accounts](glossary://investment/SEP-accounts) with pre-tax dollars and reduce their current year's net income.

    desc: |-4
        A [tax-exempt](glossary://investment/tax-exempt) deferred [compensation](glossary://investment/compensation) program made available to employees of state and federal governments and agencies. A 457 plan is similar to a [401(k) plan](glossary://investment/401(k) plan), except there are never employer matching [contributions](glossary://investment/contributions) and the [IRS](glossary://investment/IRS) does not consider it a [qualified retirement plan](glossary://investment/qualified-retirement-plan). Participants can defer some of their annual income (up to an annual limit), and contributions and earnings are [tax-deferred](glossary://investment/tax-deferred) until withdrawal. Distributions start at [retirement](glossary://investment/retirement) age but participants can also take distributions if they change jobs or in certain emergencies. Participants can choose to take distributions as a lump sum, annual installments or as an annuity. Distributions are subject to ordinary income taxes and the amounts cannot be transferred into an [IRA](glossary://investment/IRA).

After extracting a portion of the value of the policy for costs and profits, these companies offered the remainder of the [death benefit](glossary://investment/death-benefit) to terminally ill policy holders.

        The most commonly used accounting method, which reports income when earned and [expenses](glossary://investment/expenses) when incurred, as opposed to [cash basis](glossary://investment/cash-basis) [accounting](glossary://investment/accounting), which reports income when received and expenses when paid. Under the accrual method, companies do have some discretion as to when income and expenses are recognized, but there are rules governing the recognition.

An accrual bond has the important advantage of being free of reinvestment [risk](glossary://investment/risk), though the downside is that there is no opportunity to enjoy the effects of a rise in market [interest rates](glossary://investment/interest-rates).

Accrued interest is calculated on a 30-day month/360-day year for corporate bonds and municipal [bond](glossary://investment/bond)s, and on actual-calendar-days for Government bonds.

        Any [interest](glossary://investment/interest) rate that changes on a periodic basis. The change is usually tied to movement of an outside indicator, such as the prime interest rate.

This means that the rate on the loan will always be 2% higher than the [prime rate](glossary://investment/prime-rate), which changes regularly to take into account changes in the [inflation](glossary://investment/inflation) rate. For an individual taking out a loan when rates are low, a [fixed rate](glossary://investment/fixed-rate) loan would allow him or her to lock in the low rates and not be concerned with fluctuations. On the other hand, if [interest rates](glossary://investment/interest-rates) were historically high at the time of the loan, he or she would benefit from a floating rate loan, because as the prime rate fell to historically normal levels, the rate on the loan would decrease.

    desc: |-4
        Charges made against the [interest](glossary://investment/interest) received on a [debt](glossary://investment/debt) in order to offset a [premium](glossary://investment/premium) paid for the debt. Thus, with each periodic payment, a debtor is not only paying back interest, but also part of his or her premium. This leads to higher periodic payments than in the case when only interest is paid out. However, a payment schedule which includes premium [amortization](glossary://investment/amortization) makes debt management easier, especially if the [principal](glossary://investment/principal) is large. While paying just the interest each period will lead will lead to a low outflow of cash each month, the debtor might not save enough to pay the principal. Thus, amortizing the premium each period also reduces the [credit risk](glossary://investment/credit-risk) of the debt, since the creditor gets some part of the principal each time period, as opposed to allowing a debtor to forfeit on all of it at the [maturity](glossary://investment/maturity) of the loan. Amortization of premium is a common feature in cases when a person or company takes on a large amount of debt at one time, such as a [mortgage](glossary://investment/mortgage).

    desc: |-4
        A [debt instrument](glossary://investment/debt-instrument) issued for a period of more than one year with the purpose of raising capital by borrowing. The Federal government, states, cities, corporations, and many other types of institutions sell bonds. Generally, a bond is a promise to repay the [principal](glossary://investment/principal) along with [interest](glossary://investment/interest) ([coupons](glossary://investment/coupons)) on a specified date (maturity). Some bonds do not pay interest, but all bonds require a repayment of principal. When an [investor](glossary://investment/investor) buys a bond, he/she becomes a [creditor](glossary://investment/creditor) of the issuer. However, the buyer does not gain any kind of ownership rights to the issuer, unlike in the case of equities. On the hand, a bond holder has a greater claim on an issuer's income than a shareholder in the case of financial distress (this is true for all creditors). Bonds are often divided into different categories based on [tax](glossary://investment/tax) status, credit quality, issuer type, [maturity](glossary://investment/maturity) and secured/unsecured (and there are several other ways to classify bonds as well). U.S. Treasury bonds are generally considered the safest unsecured bonds, since the possibility of the Treasury defaulting on payments is almost zero. The yield from a bond is made up of three components: coupon interest, [capital gains](glossary://investment/capital-gains) and interest on interest (if a bond pays no [coupon](glossary://investment/coupon) interest, the only yield will be capital gains). A bond might be sold at above or below [par](glossary://investment/par) (the amount paid out at maturity), but the [market price](glossary://investment/market-price) will approach par value as the bond approaches maturity. A riskier bond has to provide a higher payout to compensate for that additional risk. Some bonds are tax-exempt, and these are typically issued by municipal, county or state governments, whose interest payments are not subject to federal income tax, and sometimes also state or local income tax.

  - name: bonded
    also: surety bond
    desc: |-4
        Guaranteed by a [bond](glossary://investment/bond), thereby insuring that a [payment](glossary://investment/payment) is made or that specific rules are followed. Failure to meet the stipulations may result in [forfeiture](glossary://investment/forfeiture) of the bond.

  - name: bondholder

    desc: |-4
        The owner of a [bond](glossary://investment/bond).

    desc: |-4
        Free [shares](glossary://investment/shares) of [stock](glossary://investment/stock) given to current [shareholders](glossary://investment/shareholders), based upon the number of shares that a shareholder owns. While this stock [action](glossary://investment/action) increases the number of shares owned, it does not increase the total [value](glossary://investment/value). This is due to the fact that since the total number of shares increases, the ratio of number of shares held to number of shares outstanding remains constant.

  - name: book inventory
    also: inventory, continuous inventory, perpetual inventory
    desc: |-4
        What [stock](glossary://investment/stock) on hand should be according to the accounting records. There might be small discrepancies between book inventory and actual stock on hand, especially in larger companies when it is difficult to keep a very precise record of stock on hand.

This is how much the company would have left over in [assets](glossary://investment/assets) if it went out of business immediately. Since companies are usually expected to grow and generate more [profits](glossary://investment/profits) in the future, most companies end up being worth far more in the marketplace than their book value would suggest. For this reason, book value is of more [interest](glossary://investment/interest) to [value](glossary://investment/value) [investors](glossary://investment/investors) than [growth](glossary://investment/growth) investors.

    desc: |-4
        A customer's [account](glossary://investment/account) at a [brokerage](glossary://investment/brokerage). There are three kinds of brokerage accounts. The most basic kind is a cash-management account, into which [investors](glossary://investment/investors) place money in order to make [trades](glossary://investment/trades). There must be enough money in the account to cover the trade at the time of its execution (including both the price of the [security](glossary://investment/security) and the [commission](glossary://investment/commission)), or the [investor](glossary://investment/investor) must be able to pay for the trade within three days (which is called the [settlement date](glossary://investment/settlement-date)). Some brokerage firms accept [credit cards](glossary://investment/credit-cards) to fund [cash accounts](glossary://investment/cash-accounts), but the most require cash or a personal check. Such an account is often a good substitute for a bank account. A second, more sophisticated kind of brokerage account is a [margin account](glossary://investment/margin-account), which allows an investor to buy securities with money borrowed from the broker. The Federal Reserve limits margin borrowing to at most 50% of the amount invested, but some brokerages have even stricter requirements, especially for volatile stocks. brokerages charge a relatively low [interest rate](glossary://investment/interest-rate) on [margin loans](glossary://investment/margin-loans) in order to encourage investors to buy on margin. A third kind of brokerage account is a [discretionary account](glossary://investment/discretionary-account), which permits the broker to buy and sell shares for the investor without first contacting the investor for approval.

  - name: budget surplus
    also: surplus, Federal Surplus
    desc: |-4
        The amount by which a government's, company's, or individual's income exceeds its spending over a particular period of time. Generally, a government does not need to maintain a budget surplus. However, a government has to be careful about running a [budget deficit](glossary://investment/budget-deficit) to make sure that the means of financing the deficit do not cause too much of an interest burden. In general, economists become worried when government [debt](glossary://investment/debt), the most common way of financing a government deficit, rises sharply as a proportion of Gross Domestic Product. This is because [interest](glossary://investment/interest) payments might also rise as a proportion of Gross Domestic Product unless the government manages to sufficiently reduce the average interest rate paid on the debt. An increasing interest burden means that government revenues will be diverted to pay for financing costs, as opposed to being used for more productive purposes. As in the case of the government, individuals and corporations do not have to ensure that their budgets are in surplus or balanced, but they have to be mindful of interest costs as a proportion of their income. Some economists believe that manipulation of the government budget surplus is an effective way of stimulating or slowing economic growth. However, other economists say that manipulating the budget deficit will only result in a change in the price level in the economy, since actual production change in an economy is only decided by changes in the labor force, the state of technology, and productivity of the workforce.

An investor who chose to invest $10,000 in Berkshire Hathaway when Buffett took over in 1965, would have more than $20 million today. Buffett provides strong evidence that it is possible to consistently [outperform](glossary://investment/outperform) the market. His forte is in identifying [undervalued](glossary://investment/undervalued) companies, and he is well-known for taking a very long-term positions in companies he identifies as being good [investment](glossary://investment/investment) prospects. Warren Buffett's style of analyzing companies is solidly based in looking at [fundamentals](glossary://investment/fundamentals). He thinks of his [investment](glossary://investment/investment) as buying a piece of a business, not just shares of its stock. He also believes that diversification is less necessary for those able to confidently choose a select number of stocks they are confident will significantly outperform the market. Buffett determines the value of a business by totaling the [net cash flows](glossary://investment/net-cash-flows) he expects to occur over the life of the company and [discounting](glossary://investment/discounting) them by the appropriate [interest rate](glossary://investment/interest-rate).

  - name: callable bond
    also: first call date, yield to call, put bond
    desc: |-4
        A [bond](glossary://investment/bond) which the issuer has the right to [redeem](glossary://investment/redeem) prior to its [maturity](glossary://investment/maturity) date, under certain conditions. When issued, the bond will explain when it can be redeemed and what the price will be. In most cases, the price will be slightly above the [par](glossary://investment/par) value for the bond and will increase the earlier the bond is called. A company will often [call](glossary://investment/call) a bond if it is paying a higher coupon than the current market [interest rates](glossary://investment/interest-rates). Basically, the company can reissue the same bonds at a lower interest rate, saving them some amount on all the coupon payments; this process is called [refunding](glossary://investment/refunding). Unfortunately, these are also the same circumstances in which the bonds have the highest price; interest rates have decreased since the bonds were issued, increasing the price. In many cases, the company will have the right to call the bonds at a lower price than the market price. If a bond is called, the bondholder will be notified by mail and have no choice in the matter. The [bond](glossary://investment/bond) will stop paying [interest](glossary://investment/interest) shortly after the bond is called, so there is no reason to hold on to it. Companies also typically advertise in major financial publications to notify bondholders. Generally, callable bonds will carry something called [call protection](glossary://investment/call-protection). This means that there is some period of time during which the bond cannot be called. (aka: redeemable bond) &lt;b&gt;opposite of&lt;/b&gt; irredeemable bond or non-callable bond.

        Able to be redeemed prior to [maturity](glossary://investment/maturity). The term usually applies to [bonds](glossary://investment/bonds) and convertible securities. The issuer of a callable security has to state the conditions under which the security may be called at the time of issue. For most securities, there is a certain initial time period in which the security cannot be called. A bond will usually be called when market interest rates fall below the yield being paid on the bond (bonds are usually called when the price rises to a certain point). To reflect this risk, a callable security is usually priced lower than a non-callable security.

        A [corporate bond](glossary://investment/corporate-bond), usually a junior debenture, that can be exchanged, at the option of the holder, for a specific number of shares of the company's [preferred stock](glossary://investment/preferred-stock) or [common stock](glossary://investment/common-stock). Convertibility affects the performance of the [bond](glossary://investment/bond) in certain ways. First and foremost, convertible bonds tend to have lower [interest rates](glossary://investment/interest-rates) than non-convertibles because they also accrue value as the price of the underlying stock rises. In this way, convertible bonds offer some of the benefits of both stocks and bonds. Convertibles earn [interest](glossary://investment/interest) even when the stock is trading down or sideways, but when the stock prices rises, the value of the convertible increases. Therefore, convertibles can offer protection against a decline in stock price. Because they are sold at a [premium](glossary://investment/premium) over the price of the stock, convertibles should be expected to earn that premium back in the first three or four years after purchase. In some cases, convertibles may be [callable](glossary://investment/callable), at which point the yield will cease.

  - name: convertible hedge
    desc: |-4
        An [arbitrage](glossary://investment/arbitrage) strategy which involves buying a [convertible security](glossary://investment/convertible-security) while simultaneously selling short the same company's [common stock](glossary://investment/common-stock). This strategy involves identifying [stocks](glossary://investment/stocks) that are mispriced by the market, [shorting](glossary://investment/shorting) the stock and buying a convertible security issued by that company. Having sold the stock short, the [investor](glossary://investment/investor) puts proceeds in an [interest](glossary://investment/interest)-bearing account. If the [stock](glossary://investment/stock) price stays the same, then the investor will earn interest on the short sale proceeds and interest on the convertible security, while paying fees to the lender of the stock. In most cases, this situation will lead to a positive net [cash flow](glossary://investment/cash-flow). If the stock price rises, then the investor gains on the convertible stock, but loses (hopefully a smaller amount) on the short sale position. If the stock price falls, the price of the convertible falls, but the value of the convertible will never fall below the value that an ordinary [bond](glossary://investment/bond) issued by the company would have. On the other hand, the investor makes a gain on the short position (hopefully more than the amount lost on the convertible). A convertible hedge is considered a relatively safe strategy, but choosing which ones to pursue is complex and so convertible hedges are done primarily by professional [investment managers](glossary://investment/investment-managers) who are supported by powerful analytical tools.

  - name: credit bureau
    also: credit rating, downgrade, upgrade
    desc: |-4
        An agency which collects and sells information about the creditworthiness of individuals. A credit reporting agency does not make any decisions about whether a specific person should be extended [credit](glossary://investment/credit) or not. However, it does collect information that it considers relevant to a person's credit habits and history, and uses this information to assign a [credit score](glossary://investment/credit-score) to indicate how creditworthy a person is. When a prospective [creditor](glossary://investment/creditor) approaches a credit reporting agency to inquire about a particular person, they are sold a [credit report](glossary://investment/credit-report) which contains all the information relevant to the person and the credit score calculated by the agency (some creditors might have an ongoing subscription to credit bureau). The prospective creditor then uses that information to decide whether to extend the applicant the desired credit or not. Same as credit bureau. (aka: consumer reporting agency)

        A specific kind of counterparty agreement which allows the transfer of third party [credit risk](glossary://investment/credit-risk) from one party to the other. One party in the swap is a lender and faces credit risk from a third party, and the counterparty in the credit default swap agrees to insure this risk in exchange of regular periodic payments (essentially an [insurance](glossary://investment/insurance) premium). If the third party defaults, the party providing insurance will have to purchase from the insured party the defaulted [asset](glossary://investment/asset). In turn, the insurer pays the insured the remaining interest on the [debt](glossary://investment/debt), as well as the [principal](glossary://investment/principal).

  - name: credit derivative

Bonds issued by the federal government, for the most part, are immune from default (if the government needs money it can just print more). Bonds issued by [corporations](glossary://investment/corporations) are more likely to be defaulted on, since companies often go [bankrupt](glossary://investment/bankrupt). Municipalities occasionally default as well, although it is much less common. (aka: default risk)

    also: credit report, consumer reporting agency, credit bureau, credit scoring, FICO score
    desc: |-4
        A measure of [credit risk](glossary://investment/credit-risk) calculated from a [credit report](glossary://investment/credit-report) using a standardized formula. Factors that can damage a credit score include late payments, absence of credit references, and unfavorable [credit card](glossary://investment/credit-card) use. Lenders may use a credit score to determine whether to provide a [loan](glossary://investment/loan) and what rate to charge.

  - name: credit scoring
    desc: |-4
        A statistical technique used to determine whether to extend [credit](glossary://investment/credit) (and if so, how much) to a borrower. Credit scoring is often considered more accurate than a qualitative assessment of a person's credit worthiness, since it is based on actual data. When performing credit scoring, a [creditor](glossary://investment/creditor) will analyze a relevant sample of people (either selected from current [debtors](glossary://investment/debtors), or a similar set of people) to see what factors have the most effect on credit worthiness. Once these factors and their relative importances are established, a model is developed to calculate a credit score (a number indicating how credit-worthy the applicant is) for new applicants. The officer inputs applicant-specific information for each variable in the model, and can thus find out how credit-worthy he/she is. Developing a credit scoring model is usually a time-consuming, complicated process given that creditors often have to look at a large sample and consider many different variables. Thus, these models are usually developed at the firm level as opposed to the individual credit office level. Some of the factors considered when developing a credit scoring model are outstanding [debt](glossary://investment/debt), the number of credit accounts maintained, age, income, credit history, etc. As required by the [Equal Credit Opportunity Act](glossary://investment/Equal-Credit-Opportunity-Act), a credit scoring model cannot consider race, sex, marital status, national origin, or religion. If age is considered, the analysis should be such that older people are given equal consideration in a credit application.

    desc: |-4
        Government measures designed to limit the supply of credit in the economy, in order to curb [inflation](glossary://investment/inflation) by controlling growth in the [money supply](glossary://investment/money-supply). Two examples of credit squeeze include restricting bank lending and credit sales, and increasing interes rates.

  - name: credit union
    desc: |-4

Credit unions provide financial services for their members, including [savings](glossary://investment/savings) and [lending](glossary://investment/lending). Large organizations and companies may organize credit unions for their members and employees, respectively. To join a credit union, a person must ordinarily belong to a participating organization, such as a college alumni association or labor union. When a person deposits money in a credit union, he/she becomes a member of the union because the deposit is considered partial ownership in the credit union.

This is often done when there is no derivatives contract for the instrument being hedged, or a suitable derivatives contract exists but the market is highly [illiquid](glossary://investment/illiquid). The success of cross-hedging depends completely on how strongly correlated the instrument being hedged is with the instrument which underlies the derivatives contract. Additionally, the [credit](glossary://investment/credit) quality of the derivative and the instrument being hedged needs to be similar and their markets need to be of similar liquidity, so that price changes are similar. Lastly, the maturity of the derivatives contract must be at least as long as the [maturity](glossary://investment/maturity) of the desired [hedge](glossary://investment/hedge), otherwise the [investor](glossary://investment/investor) will be left with an unhedged exposure for a period of time.

Many DRIPs also allow the investment of additional cash from the shareholder, known as an optional cash [purchase](glossary://investment/purchase). Unlike with a Direct Stock Purchase Plan, with a DRIP the investor must purchase the first [share](glossary://investment/share) in the company through a brokerage. After that, the company will take whatever [dividends](glossary://investment/dividends) it would normally send as a check and instead it will reinvest them to purchase more shares in the company for you, all without charging a commission. The only drawback is that the [investor](glossary://investment/investor) has no control over when his/her money from the dividends is used to purchase new stock in the company, which means he/she might be buying new shares at sub-optimal times. (aka: Dividend Reinvestment Program)

For example, if a stock pays out $2 in dividends over the course of a year and [trades](glossary://investment/trades) at $40, then it has a dividend yield of 5%. Mature, well-established companies tend to have higher [dividend yields](glossary://investment/dividend-yields), while young, growth-oriented companies tend to have lower ones, and most small growing companies don't have a dividend yield at all because they don't pay out dividends.

The most widely used indicator of the overall condition of the [stock market](glossary://investment/stock-market), a price-weighted average of 30 actively traded [blue chip](glossary://investment/blue-chip) [stocks](glossary://investment/stocks), primarily industrials. The 30 stocks are chosen by the editors of the Wall Street Journal (which is published by Dow Jones &amp; Company), a practice that dates back to the beginning of the century. The Dow was officially started by Charles Dow in 1896, at which time it consisted of only 11 stocks. The Dow is computed using a price-weighted indexing system, rather than the more common market cap-weighted indexing system. Simply put, the editors at WSJ add up the prices of all the stocks and then divide by the number of stocks in the [index](glossary://investment/index).

If the internal rate of return exceeds the cost of financing the project, then the project is viable. The internal rate of return is also useful in ranking competing investment projects (the higher the internal rate of return, the better the project is), but there are some limitations with this technique. First, if [cash flows](glossary://investment/cash-flows) change from negative or positive, or vice versa, a unique internal rate of return cannot be calculated, Second, in the case that competing projects are being considered, the internal rate of return criteria sometimes gives a different ranking than the net present value criteria. Thus, net present value is usually preferred over internal rate of return, since net present value is a specific number and is usually easier to calculate. (aka: dollar-weighted rate of return)

The most widely used indicator of the overall condition of the [stock market](glossary://investment/stock-market), a price-weighted average of 30 actively traded [blue chip](glossary://investment/blue-chip) [stocks](glossary://investment/stocks), primarily industrials. The 30 stocks are chosen by the editors of the Wall Street Journal (which is published by Dow Jones &amp; Company), a practice that dates back to the beginning of the century. The Dow was officially started by Charles Dow in 1896, at which time it consisted of only 11 stocks. The Dow is computed using a price-weighted indexing system, rather than the more common market cap-weighted indexing system.

(In actuality, the divisor is much higher today in order to account for [stock splits](glossary://investment/stock-splits) that have occurred in the past.)

  - name: duration gap

The [duration](glossary://investment/duration) of each asset or liability defines an interval that must be assessed.

  - name: duration
    also: effective duration, modified duration
    desc: |-4
        The change in the value of a fixed income security that will result from a 1% change in [interest rates](glossary://investment/interest-rates). Duration is stated in years. For example, a 5 year duration means the [bond](glossary://investment/bond) will decrease in value by 5% if interest rates rise 1% and increase in value by 5% if interest rates fall 1%. Duration is a weighted measure of the length of time the bond will pay out. Unlike [maturity](glossary://investment/maturity), duration takes into account [interest](glossary://investment/interest) payments that occur throughout the course of holding the bond. Basically, duration is a [weighted average](glossary://investment/weighted-average) of the maturity of all the income streams from a bond or [portfolio](glossary://investment/portfolio) of bonds. So, for a two-year bond with 4 [coupon](glossary://investment/coupon) payments every six months of $50 and a $1000 face value, duration (in years) is 0.5(50/1200) + 1(50/1200)+ 1.5(50/1200)+ 2(50/1200) + 2(1000/1200) = 1.875 years. Notice that the duration on any bond that pays coupons will be less than the maturity because there is some amount of the payments that are going to come before the maturity date. In this example, the maturity was 2 years. [Investors](glossary://investment/Investors) use duration to measure the [volatility](glossary://investment/volatility) of the bond. Generally, the higher the duration (the longer an investor needs to wait for the bulk of the payments), the more its price will drop as interest rates go up. Of course, with the added [risk](glossary://investment/risk) comes greater expected returns. If an investor expects interest rates to fall during the course of the time the bond is held, a bond with a long duration would be appealing because the bond's price would increase more than comparable bonds with shorter durations.

    desc: |-4
        The expected quarterly or annual [earnings](glossary://investment/earnings) of a given company, as estimated by an [analyst](glossary://investment/analyst) or other market individual or company. Earnings estimates are watched closely by investors because they are an important indication of the company's outlook, but even the professionals have difficulty predicting earnings accurately.

    desc: |-4
        A measure of growth in a company's [net income](glossary://investment/net-income) over a specific period, often one year. The term can apply to actual data from previous periods or estimated data for future periods.

  - name: earnings multiple
    desc: |-4
        The most common measure of how expensive a stock is. The earnings multiple is equal to a stock's [market capitalization](glossary://investment/market-capitalization) divided by its [after-tax](glossary://investment/after-tax) [earnings](glossary://investment/earnings) over a 12-month period, usually the trailing period but occasionally the current or forward period. The value is the same whether the calculation is done for the whole company or on a per-share basis. The higher the earnings multiple, the more the market is willing to pay for each dollar of annual earnings. The last year's earnings multiple would be actual, while current year and forward year earnings multiple would be estimates, but in each case, the P in the equation is the current price. Companies that are not currently profitable (that is, ones which have negative earnings) don't have a earnings multiple at all. (aka: price/earnings ratio (P/E ratio))

  - name: earnings multiplier

Companies often use a [weighted average](glossary://investment/weighted-average) of shares outstanding over the reporting term. EPS can be calculated for the previous year (trailing EPS), for the current year (current EPS), or for the coming year (forward EPS). Note that last year's EPS would be actual, while current year and forward year EPS would be estimates.

  - name: earnings report
    also: annual report, quarterly report, balance sheet
    desc: |-4
        An official quarterly or annual financial document published by a [public company](glossary://investment/public-company), showing [earnings](glossary://investment/earnings), expenses, and [net profit](glossary://investment/net-profit). (aka: income statement or profit and loss statement)

Earnings are the reason corporations exist, and are often the single most important determinant of a [stock](glossary://investment/stock)'s price. Earnings are important to [investors](glossary://investment/investors) because they give an indication of the company's expected future [dividends](glossary://investment/dividends) and its potential for [growth](glossary://investment/growth) and [capital](glossary://investment/capital) [appreciation](glossary://investment/appreciation). That does not necessarily mean that low or negative earnings always indicate a bad stock; for example, many young companies report negative earnings as they attempt to grow quickly enough to capture a new market, at which point they'll be even more profitable than they otherwise might have been. (aka: income)

  - name: earnout

(aka: accommodative monetary policy or loose credit) &lt;b&gt;opposite of&lt;/b&gt; [tight monetary policy](glossary://investment/tight-monetary-policy).

  - name: eating stock

        What an [underwriter](glossary://investment/underwriter) does when he/she can't find enough buyers and is forced to purchase the [stock](glossary://investment/stock) for his/her own [account](glossary://investment/account). To cover for [risk](glossary://investment/risk) associated with not being able to find enough buyers for an issue, underwriters charge an underwriting fee. Thus, even in an underwriter is eating stock, he/she might still make a [profit](glossary://investment/profit) on the deal. However, in the situation that a new issue is severely undersubscribed, the underwriter might make a loss on the deal.

  - name: EBIDTA
    desc: |-4
        Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization. An approximate measure of a company's operating [cash flow](glossary://investment/cash-flow) based on data from the company's [income statement](glossary://investment/income-statement). Calculated by looking at [earnings](glossary://investment/earnings) before the deduction of [interest expenses](glossary://investment/interest-expenses), [taxes](glossary://investment/taxes), [depreciation](glossary://investment/depreciation), and [amortization](glossary://investment/amortization). This earnings measure is of a lot of interest in cases where companies have large amounts of [fixed assets](glossary://investment/fixed-assets) which are subject to heavy depreciation charges (e.g. manufacturing companies) or in the case where a company has a large amount of acquired [intangible assets](glossary://investment/intangible-assets) on its books and is thus subject to large amortization charges (e.g. a company that has purchased a brand or a company that has recently made a large [acquisition](glossary://investment/acquisition)). Since the distortionary accounting and financing effects on company earnings do not feature in EBIDTA, it is a good way of comparing companies within and across industries. This measure is also of a lot of interest to a company's creditors, since EBIDTA is essentially the income that a company has free for [interest](glossary://investment/interest) payments. In general, EBIDTA is a useful measure only for large companies with significant assets, and/or for companies with a significant amount of [debt](glossary://investment/debt) financing. It is rarely a useful measure for evaluating a small company with no significant borrowings. Sometimes (aka: EBITDA or operational cash flow)

  - name: EBIT
    desc: |-4
        Earnings Before Interest and Taxes. A measure of a company's earning power from ongoing operations, equal to [earnings](glossary://investment/earnings) before deduction of [interest](glossary://investment/interest) payments and [income taxes](glossary://investment/income-taxes). EBIT excludes [income](glossary://investment/income) and [expenditure](glossary://investment/expenditure) from unusual, non-recurring or discontinued activities. In the case of a company with minimal [depreciation](glossary://investment/depreciation) and [amortization](glossary://investment/amortization) activities, EBIT is watched closely by [creditors](glossary://investment/creditors), since it represents the amount of [cash](glossary://investment/cash) that such a company will be able to use to pay off creditors. (aka: operating profit)

  - name: EBITDA margin
    desc: |-4
        Equal to [EBITDA](glossary://investment/EBITDA) divided by total [revenue](glossary://investment/revenue). EBITDA margin measures the extent to which cash [operating](glossary://investment/operating) expenses use up revenue.

Traditional business cycles undergo four stages: [expansion](glossary://investment/expansion), [prosperity](glossary://investment/prosperity), [contraction](glossary://investment/contraction), and [recession](glossary://investment/recession). After a recessionary phase, the expansionary phase can start again. The phases of the business cycle are characterized by changing employment, industrial [productivity](glossary://investment/productivity), and [interest rates](glossary://investment/interest-rates). Some economists believe that stock price trends precede business cycle stages.

  - name: economic growth rate

  - name: Efficient Market Theory
    also: random walk theory, behavioral finance, inefficient market
    desc: |-4
        The (now largely discredited) theory that all market participants receive and act on all of the relevant information as soon as it becomes available. If this were strictly true, no [investment](glossary://investment/investment) [strategy](glossary://investment/strategy) would be better than a coin toss. Proponents of the efficient market theory believe that there is perfect information in the [stock market](glossary://investment/stock-market). This means that whatever information is available about a [stock](glossary://investment/stock) to one investor is available to all investors (except, of course, insider information, but [insider trading](glossary://investment/insider-trading) is illegal). Since everyone has the same information about a stock, the price of a stock should reflect the knowledge and expectations of all investors. The bottom line is that an investor should not be able to beat the market since there is no way for him/her to know something about a stock that isnâ€™t already reflected in the stock's [price](glossary://investment/price). Proponents of this theory do not try to pick stocks that are going to be winners; instead, they simply try to match the market's performance. However, there is ample evidence to dispute the basic claims of this theory, and most investors don't believe it.

ETFs always bundle together the [securities](glossary://investment/securities) that are in an index; they never track actively managed [mutual fund](glossary://investment/mutual-fund) [portfolios](glossary://investment/portfolios) (because most actively managed funds only disclose their holdings a few times a year, so the ETF would not know when to adjust its holdings most of the time). Investors can do just about anything with an ETF that they can do with a normal stock, such as short selling. Because ETFs are traded on [stock exchanges](glossary://investment/stock-exchanges), they can be bought and sold at any time during the day (unlike most mutual funds). Their price will fluctuate from moment to moment, just like any other stock's price, and an investor will need a [broker](glossary://investment/broker) in order to purchase them, which means that he/she will have to pay a commission. On the plus side, ETFs are more [tax](glossary://investment/tax)-efficient than normal mutual funds, and since they track indexes they have very low operating and transaction costs associated with them. There are no sales loads or investment minimums required to purchase an ETF. The first ETF created was the Standard and Poor's Deposit Receipt (SPDR, pronounced Spider) in 1993. SPDRs gave investors an easy way to track the S&amp;P 500 without buying an index fund, and they soon become quite popular.

    also: QQQ
    desc: |-4
        ETF. A fund that tracks an index, but can be traded like a [stock](glossary://investment/stock). ETFs always bundle together the [securities](glossary://investment/securities) that are in an index; they never track actively managed [mutual fund](glossary://investment/mutual-fund) [portfolios](glossary://investment/portfolios) (because most actively managed funds only disclose their holdings a few times a year, so the ETF would not know when to adjust its holdings most of the time). Investors can do just about anything with an ETF that they can do with a normal stock, such as short selling. Because ETFs are traded on [stock exchanges](glossary://investment/stock-exchanges), they can be bought and sold at any time during the day (unlike most mutual funds). Their price will fluctuate from moment to moment, just like any other stock's price, and an investor will need a [broker](glossary://investment/broker) in order to purchase them, which means that he/she will have to pay a commission. On the plus side, ETFs are more [tax](glossary://investment/tax)-efficient than normal mutual funds, and since they track indexes they have very low operating and transaction costs associated with them. There are no sales loads or investment minimums required to purchase an ETF. The first ETF created was the Standard and Poor's Deposit Receipt (SPDR, pronounced Spider) in 1993. SPDRs gave investors an easy way to track the S&amp;P 500 without buying an index fund, and they soon become quite popular.

This committee consists of 7 members of the Board of Governors, and 5 of the 12 [Federal Reserve Bank](glossary://investment/Federal-Reserve-Bank) Presidents. This group, headed by the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, sets interest rates either directly (by changing the [discount rate](glossary://investment/discount-rate)) or through the use of [open market operations](glossary://investment/open-market-operations) (by buying and selling government [securities](glossary://investment/securities) which affects the federal funds rate). The discount rate is the rate at which the Federal Reserve Bank charges member banks for overnight loans.

This rate is set during the FOMC meetings by the regional banks and the Federal Reserve Board. The federal funds rate is the interest rate at which banks loan excess reserves to each other. While the Fed can't directly affect this rate, it effectively controls it through the way it buys and sells Treasuries to banks. There are 8 scheduled FOMC meetings during the course of each year.

  - name: Federal Reserve System
    also: Board of Governors, the Desk, draining reserves, Federal Open Market Committee, National Bank, Primary Dealer, reserve requirement
    desc: |-4
        The central banking system of the U.S., comprised of the Federal Reserve Board, the 12 [Federal Reserve Banks](glossary://investment/Federal-Reserve-Banks), and the national and state member banks. Its primary purpose is to regulate the flow of money and [credit](glossary://investment/credit) in the country. The Federal Reserve was established in 1913 to maintain a sound and stable banking system throughout the United States and to promote a strong economy. The Board of Governors is made up of 7 members that are appointed to 14-year terms by the President and approved by the Senate. Almost all U.S. banks are a part of the Federal Reserve System, which requires that those banks maintain a certain percentage of their [assets](glossary://investment/assets) deposited with the regional Federal Reserve Bank. These reserve requirements are set by the Board of Governors and by changing the requirements, the Federal Reserve System can greatly impact the amount of [money supply](glossary://investment/money-supply) in the economy. The Federal Reserve System has several functions. First, it serves as a bank for banks: many [transactions](glossary://investment/transactions) between banks are processed through the Federal Reserve System. Financial institutions are also able to borrow money through the Federal Reserve, but only after attempting to find credit elsewhere; the Federal Reserve System provides credit only when it cannot be found in the markets or in cases of emergency. Second, the Federal Reserve System acts as the government's bank. The [tax](glossary://investment/tax) system processes incoming and outgoing payments through a Federal Reserve checking account. The Federal Reserve also buys and sells government [securities](glossary://investment/securities). The Fed even issues the U.S. currency, although the actual production of the currency is handled elsewhere. Third, the Federal Reserve System acts as a regulatory agency. The Fed polices the banking industry to make sure that things run smoothly and that the rights of [consumers](glossary://investment/consumers) are protected..

    also: monetary policy
    desc: |-4
        Decisions by the President and Congress, usually relating to taxation and government spending, with the goals of full employment, price stability, and [economic growth](glossary://investment/economic-growth). By changing [tax](glossary://investment/tax) laws, the government can effectively modify the amount of disposable income available to its taxpayers. For example, if taxes were to increase, consumers would have less [disposable income](glossary://investment/disposable-income) and in turn would have less money to spend on goods and services. This difference in disposable income would go to the government instead of going to consumers, who would pass the money onto companies. Or, the government could choose to increase government spending by directly purchasing goods and services from private companies. This would increase the flow of money through the economy and would eventually increase the disposable income available to consumers. Unfortunately, this process takes time, as the money needs to wind its way through the economy, creating a significant lag between the implementation of fiscal policy and its effect on the economy.

        same as unit investment trust. An SEC-registered investment company which purchases a fixed, unmanaged portfolio of income-producing [securities](glossary://investment/securities) and then sells shares in the trust to investors. The major difference between a Unit investment Trust and a [mutual fund](glossary://investment/mutual-fund) is that a mutual fund is actively managed, while a unit investment trust is not managed at all. Capital gains, interest and [dividend](glossary://investment/dividend) payments from the trust are passed on to [shareholders](glossary://investment/shareholders) at regular periods. If the trust is one that invests only in tax-free securities, then the income from the trust is also tax-free. A unit [investment](glossary://investment/investment) trust is generally considered a low-risk, low-return investment. One downside of a unit investment trust is that given the fixed nature of its [portfolio](glossary://investment/portfolio), the trust is susceptible to inflation. (aka: unit investment trust or participating trust or fixed investment trust)

  - name: fixed-rate loan
    desc: |-4
        A loan in which the [interest rate](glossary://investment/interest-rate) does not change during the entire term of the loan. For an individual taking out a loan when rates are low, the fixed rate loan would allow him or her to lock in the low rates and not be concerned with fluctuations. On the other hand, if interest rates were historically high at the time of the loan, he or she would benefit from a floating rate loan, because as the prime rate fell to historically normal levels, the rate on the loan would decrease. &lt;b&gt;opposite of&lt;/b&gt; adjustable rate.

        The practice of buying [initial public offerings](glossary://investment/initial-public-offerings) at the offering price and then reselling them once trading has begun, usually for a substantial profit. This is more commonly done by institutional investors than retail investors, because institutional investors get most of the IPO shares at the offering price. Flipping is most profitable in a hot IPO market, when the price of an IPO often rises dramatically above the offering price on the first day. (aka: stagging)

  - name: floating debt
    desc: |-4
        Continuously refinanced short-term debt for a company's ongoing operations. The advantage of floating debt is that there is a chance to benefit from reductions in [interest rates](glossary://investment/interest-rates). In addition, interest rates on [long-term](glossary://investment/long-term) debt are often higher than interest rates on short-term debt, so the company might be saving itself money by refinancing short-term debt as opposed to borrowing long-term. However, the downside is that the company might suffer if interest rates rise and they have to refinance at a higher cost.

  - name: floating exchange rate
    also: adjustable rate, currency swap, interest rate cap

  - name: floating rate
    desc: |-4
        Any [interest](glossary://investment/interest) rate that changes on a periodic basis. The change is usually tied to movement of an outside indicator, such as the prime interest rate. Movement above or below certain levels is often prevented by a predetermined floor and ceiling for a given rate. For example, you might see a rate set at prime plus 2%. This means that the rate on the loan will always be 2% higher than the [prime rate](glossary://investment/prime-rate), which changes regularly to take into account changes in the [inflation](glossary://investment/inflation) rate. For an individual taking out a loan when rates are low, a [fixed rate](glossary://investment/fixed-rate) loan would allow him or her to lock in the low rates and not be concerned with fluctuations. On the other hand, if [interest rates](glossary://investment/interest-rates) were historically high at the time of the loan, he or she would benefit from a floating rate loan, because as the prime rate fell to historically normal levels, the rate on the loan would decrease. (aka: adjustable rate)

    desc: |-4
        A [mutual fund](glossary://investment/mutual-fund) that holds large positions in a small number of stocks. While most mutual funds hold 100-200 positions, a focused fund will usually hold only 10-30 positions. They emphasize quality over quantity, and would rather hold just the stocks they have the most confidence in, rather than diversifying across a large number of holdings. In theory this should enable them to more thoroughly research and track their holdings, although they lose the [benefits](glossary://investment/benefits) of diversification and tend to be more [volatile](glossary://investment/volatile) than other mutual funds.

  - name: follow-on

    desc: |-4
        Federal Open Market Committee. A 12-member committee which sets [credit](glossary://investment/credit) and [interest rate](glossary://investment/interest-rate) policies for the Federal Reserve System. This committee consists of 7 members of the Board of Governors, and 5 of the 12 [Federal Reserve Bank](glossary://investment/Federal-Reserve-Bank) Presidents. This group, headed by the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, sets interest rates either directly (by changing the [discount rate](glossary://investment/discount-rate)) or through the use of [open market operations](glossary://investment/open-market-operations) (by buying and selling government [securities](glossary://investment/securities) which affects the federal funds rate). The discount rate is the rate at which the Federal Reserve Bank charges member banks for overnight loans. The Fed actually controls this rate directly, but it tends to have little impact on the activities of banks because these funds are available elsewhere. This rate is set during the FOMC meetings by the regional banks and the Federal Reserve Board. The federal funds rate is the interest rate at which banks loan excess reserves to each other. While the Fed can't directly affect this rate, it effectively controls it through the way it buys and sells Treasuries to banks. There are 8 scheduled FOMC meetings during the course of each year. However, when circumstances dictate, the Fed can make inter-meeting rate changes.

Unlike [futures](glossary://investment/futures) contracts (which occur through a clearing firm), forward contracts are privately negotiated and are not standardized. Further, the two parties must bear each other's [credit risk](glossary://investment/credit-risk), which is not the case with a futures contract.

Given the lack of standardization in these contracts, there is very little scope for a secondary market in forwards. The price specified in a forward contract for a specific commodity. The forward price makes the forward contract have no value when the contract is written. However, if the value of the underlying commodity changes, the value of the forward contract becomes positive or negative, depending on the position held.

  - name: franchised monopoly
    desc: |-4
        A government-granted [monopoly](glossary://investment/monopoly).

This is usually the case when very large [economy](glossary://investment/economy) of [scale](glossary://investment/scale) is needed to make production efficient (so the [marginal cost](glossary://investment/marginal-cost) of producing each additional unit is very low).

Thus, the government may decide to simply give a producer a monopoly, so that the producer is convinced of the fact that there is adequate market to achieve efficient scale. A government may also choose to grant monopolies in special conditions such as when they want to encourage a specific kinds of innovation (patents are effectively a government-granted monopoly), give preference to a producer who might also be involved in community development activities etc.

Negative free cash flow is not necessarily an indication of a bad company, however, since many young companies put a lot of their cash into investments, which diminishes their free cash flow. But if a company is spending so much cash, it should have a good reason for doing so and it should be earning a sufficiently high rate of return on its investments.

For a firm that has a lot of [stock options](glossary://investment/stock-options), warrants, convertible bonds and preferred stock [outstanding](glossary://investment/outstanding), the fully diluted earnings per share are the most appropriate way of looking at earnings on a per share basis.

        The individual responsible for making decisions related to any portfolio of [investments](glossary://investment/investments) (often a [mutual fund](glossary://investment/mutual-fund), pension fund, or [insurance](glossary://investment/insurance) fund), in accordance with the stated goals of the fund.

    desc: |-4
        A [mutual fund](glossary://investment/mutual-fund) which invests in other mutual funds. Just as a mutual fund invests in a number of different [securities](glossary://investment/securities), a fund of funds holds shares of many different mutual funds. These funds were designed to achieve even greater diversification than traditional mutual funds. On the downside, expense fees on fund of funds are typically higher than those on regular funds because they include part of the expense fees charged by the underlying funds. In addition, since a fund of funds buys many different funds which themselves invest in many different [stocks](glossary://investment/stocks), it is possible for the fund of funds to own the same stock through several different funds and it can be difficult to keep track of the overall holdings.

  - name: fund supermarket

        A [brokerage firm](glossary://investment/brokerage-firm) that provides access to a variety of mutual funds from different fund families.

In the case of fund supermarkets, the consumers are investors, the producers are [mutual fund](glossary://investment/mutual-fund) families, and the central location is a brokerage firm. The primary benefit of a fund supermarket is simplicity: an investor can buy funds from different fund families and receive all their statements in a single report.

        Interchangeable. The term is often used to apply to financial instruments which are indentical in specifications. For example, options and futures contracts are highly fungible, since they are highly standardized arrangements. On the other hand, forwards and swaps are not, since they are customized arrangements. Instruments that are highly fungible tend to be very [liquid](glossary://investment/liquid), and so transaction costs tend to be low.

        An individual or organization accepting orders to buy or sell [futures](glossary://investment/futures) or futures options. A person or organization in this role needs to be certified by the [Commodities](glossary://investment/Commodities) and Futures Trading Commission. A futures commission [merchant](glossary://investment/merchant) has a role in the futures market similar to that of a broker in the [securities](glossary://investment/securities) market. In addition to accepting [buy](glossary://investment/buy) or [sell](glossary://investment/sell) [orders](glossary://investment/orders), the futures commission merchant can also hold their client's money or securities in [margin](glossary://investment/margin) accounts in accordance with the rules of the exchange on which they are trading. The work of a futures commission merchant may also occasionally be carried out by a full service [broker](glossary://investment/broker).

  - name: futures contract
    desc: |-4

Unlike options, futures convey an obligation to buy. The [risk](glossary://investment/risk) to the holder is unlimited, and because the payoff pattern is symmetrical, the risk to the seller is unlimited as well. Dollars lost and gained by each party on a futures contract are equal and opposite. In other words, futures trading is a [zero-sum game](glossary://investment/zero-sum-game). Futures contracts are forward contracts, meaning they represent a pledge to make a certain transaction at a future date. The exchange of [assets](glossary://investment/assets) occurs on the date specified in the contract. Futures are distinguished from generic forward contracts in that they contain standardized terms, [trade](glossary://investment/trade) on a formal exchange, are regulated by overseeing agencies, and are guaranteed by [clearinghouses](glossary://investment/clearinghouses). Also, in order to insure that payment will occur, futures have a margin requirement that must be settled daily. Finally, by making an offsetting trade, taking delivery of goods, or arranging for an exchange of goods, futures contracts can be closed. Hedgers often trade futures for the purpose of keeping price risk in check. (aka: futures)

  - name: GDP
    desc: |-4
        Gross Domestic Product. The total market value of all final goods and services produced in a country in a given year, equal to total [consumer](glossary://investment/consumer), [investment](glossary://investment/investment) and government spending, plus the value of exports, minus the value of imports. The GDP report is released at 8:30 am EST on the last day of each quarter and reflects the previous quarter. Growth in GDP is what matters, and the U.S. GDP growth has historically averaged about 2.5-3% per year but with substantial deviations. Each initial GDP report will be revised twice before the final figure is settled upon: the advance report is followed by the preliminary report about a month later and a final report a month after that. Significant revisions to the advance number can cause additional ripples through the markets. The GDP numbers are reported in two forms: current dollar and constant dollar. Current dollar GDP is calculated using today's dollars and makes comparisons between time periods difficult because of the effects of inflation. Constant dollar GDP solves this problem by converting the current information into some standard era dollar, such as 1997 dollars. This process factors out the effects of inflation and allows easy comparisons between periods. It is important to differentiate Gross Domestic Product from Gross National Product (GNP). GDP includes only goods and services produced within the geographic boundaries of the U.S., regardless of the producer's nationality. GNP doesn't include goods and services produced by foreign producers, but does include goods and services produced by U.S. firms operating in foreign countries.

        [International](glossary://investment/International), worldwide.

  - name: globalization
    desc: |-4
        Name for the process of increasing the connectivity and interdependence of the world's markets and businesses. This process has speeded up dramatically in the last two decades as technological advances make it easier for people to travel, communicate, and do business internationally. Two major recent driving forces are advances in telecommunications infrastructure and the rise of the internet. In general, as economies become more connected to other economies, they have increased opportunity but also increased competition. Thus, as globalization becomes a more and more common feature of world economics, powerful pro-globalization and anti-globalization lobbies have arisen. The pro-globalization lobby argues that globalization brings about much increased opportunities for almost everyone, and increased competition is a good thing since it makes agents of production more efficient. The two most prominent pro-globalization organizations are the World Trade Organization and the World Economic Forum. The World Trade Organization is a pan-governmental entity (which currently has 144 members) that was set up to formulate a set of rules to govern global trade and capital flows through the process of member consensus, and to supervise their member countries to ensure that the rules are being followed. The World Economic Forum, a private foundation, does not have decision-making power but enjoys a great deal importance since it has been effective as a powerful networking forum for many of the world's business, government and not-profit leaders. The anti-globalization group argues that certain groups of people who are deprived in terms of resources are not currently capable of functioning within the increased competitive pressure that will be brought about by allowing their economies to be more connected to the rest of the world. Important anti-globalization organizations include environmental groups like Friends of the Earth and Greenpeace; international aid organizations like Oxfam; third world government organizations like the G77; business organizations and trade unions whose competitiveness is threatened by globalization like the U.S. textiles and European farm lobby, as well as the Australian and U.S. trade union movements.

  - name: Gross Domestic Product
    also: GNP, deflator, recovery
    desc: |-4
        GDP. The total market value of all final goods and services produced in a country in a given year, equal to total [consumer](glossary://investment/consumer), [investment](glossary://investment/investment) and government spending, plus the value of exports, minus the value of imports. The GDP report is released at 8:30 am EST on the last day of each quarter and reflects the previous quarter. Growth in GDP is what matters, and the U.S. GDP growth has historically averaged about 2.5-3% per year but with substantial deviations. Each initial GDP report will be revised twice before the final figure is settled upon: the advance report is followed by the preliminary report about a month later and a final report a month after that. Significant revisions to the advance number can cause additional ripples through the markets. The GDP numbers are reported in two forms: current dollar and constant dollar. Current dollar GDP is calculated using today's dollars and makes comparisons between time periods difficult because of the effects of inflation. Constant dollar GDP solves this problem by converting the current information into some standard era dollar, such as 1997 dollars. This process factors out the effects of inflation and allows easy comparisons between periods. It is important to differentiate Gross Domestic Product from Gross National Product (GNP).

    desc: |-4
        The current market value of a home minus the [outstanding](glossary://investment/outstanding) mortgage balance. [Home equity](glossary://investment/Home-equity) is essentially the amount of ownership that has been built up by the holder of the mortgage through payments and appreciation. Typically, residential property is bought through a mortgage, which is then paid off over a number of years, often 15 or 30. After the mortgage has been fully repaid, the property then belongs to the [mortgagor](glossary://investment/mortgagor), namely the buyer. In the interim, however, the buyer simply builds up equity in the home. This is what a home equity loan borrows against. Although that equity cannot be sold, banks will lend money against it. Home equity loans offer significant tax savings due to the fact that the interest paid on a home equity loan is [tax-deductible](glossary://investment/tax-deductible). Home equity loans are often used to consolidate other debt with high [interest rates](glossary://investment/interest-rates) (like [credit card](glossary://investment/credit-card) debt), to finance large [expenses](glossary://investment/expenses) (such as college or a wedding), or to purchase other costly items. There are two main types of home equity loans. The first type is the traditional home equity loan, also known as the [second mortgage](glossary://investment/second-mortgage), which lends out a [lump sum](glossary://investment/lump-sum) of money that must be repaid over a fixed period. The second type is the home equity line of credit, which provides the borrower with a checkbook or a credit card that is used to borrow funds against the home equity. Funds borrowed from a traditional home equity loan start accruing interest immediately after the lump sum is disbursed; funds borrowed from a home equity line of credit do not begin accruing interest until a purchase is made against the equity.

        Fee paid as an incentive to the general partner of a hedge fund or, less frequently, the manager of a [mutual fund](glossary://investment/mutual-fund), the amount of which depends on his/her performance, usually relative to some benchmark index. Such a form of compensation could in fact extend to any financial professional, but tends to be most common among people directly responsible for managing funds. Since managers are compensated based on actual results, they will try to get the best results for their clients, but the argument is sometimes made that an incentive fee might encourage the manager to take more [risks](glossary://investment/risks) than he/she otherwise would in pursuit of maximum returns. (aka: incentive fee)

  - name: incentive stock option
    also: non-qualified stock option, non-statutory stock option
    desc: |-4
        ISO. A type of employee [stock](glossary://investment/stock) option which provides [tax](glossary://investment/tax) advantages for the employer that a non-qualified stock option does not, but which is subject to more stringent requirements. For ISOs, no income tax is due when the options are granted or when they're exercised. Instead, the tax is deferred until the holder sells the stock, at which time he/she is taxed for his/her entire gain. As long the sale is at least two years after the options were granted and at least one year after they were exercised, they'll be taxed at the lower, long-term [capital](glossary://investment/capital) gains rate; otherwise, the sale is considered a disqualifying disposition, and they'll be taxed as if they were nonqualified options (the gain at exercise is taxed as ordinary income, and any subsequent appreciation is taxed as capital gains). ISOs may not be granted at a discount to the current stock price, and they are not transferable, except through a will. (aka: qualified stock option)

  - name: index arbitrage

        A strategy designed to profit from temporary discrepancies between the prices of the stocks comprising an index and the price of a futures contract on that index. By buying either the stocks or the [futures contract](glossary://investment/futures-contract) and selling the other, an investor can sometimes exploit market inefficiency for a profit. Like all [arbitrage](glossary://investment/arbitrage) opportunities, index arbitrage opportunities disappear rapidly once the opportunity becomes well-known and many investors act on it. Index arbitrage can involve large transaction costs because of the need to simultaneously buy and sell many different stocks and futures, and so only large money managers are usually able to [profit](glossary://investment/profit) from index arbitrage. In addition, sophisticated computer programs are needed to keep track of the large number of stocks and futures involved, which makes this a very difficult trading strategy for individuals.

Indexed loans are usually long-term, since such loans might potentially be affected by many different market factors. One of the most common factors that a loan might be indexed for is inflation, since prices typically rise over time and the principal amount of the loan thus loses value with every time period, benefitting the borrower and hurting the lender. The [maturity](glossary://investment/maturity), [interest](glossary://investment/interest) or principal of an indexed loan may all be adjusted, depending on the structure of the loan.

        A promise of compensation for specific potential future losses in exchange for a periodic payment. Insurance is designed to protect the financial well-being of an individual, company or other entity in the case of unexpected loss. Some forms of insurance are required by law, while others are optional. Agreeing to the terms of an insurance policy creates a contract between the insured and the insurer.

Examples include car insurance, health insurance, disability insurance, life insurance, and business insurance.

Although the January Effect has been observed numerous times throughout history, it is difficult for investors to [profit](glossary://investment/profit) from it since the [market](glossary://investment/market) as a whole expects it to happen and therefore adjusts its [prices](glossary://investment/prices) accordingly.

Insurance companies have different rules about how much money can be extracted and how close to death the holder must be to receive benefits early.

On the downside, a living trust takes longer to put together than a will, and requires more ongoing maintenance.

In this case, increased production will not affect marginal revenue. On the other hand, if the producers supplies most or all of the market (such as in a [monopoly](glossary://investment/monopoly) or near-monopoly), then increased production is likely to reduce marginal revenue.

Momentum investors seek to take advantage of upward or downward [trends](glossary://investment/trends) in stock prices or [earnings](glossary://investment/earnings). They believe that these stocks will continue to head in the same direction because of the momentum that is already behind them. The idea relies on the belief that there are a large number of investors in the market who will buy whatever stock is already hot. Momentum investors do not necessarily believe that momentum stocks will do well in the long run, but they do think that in the short run people will continue to buy them as they have in the immediate past. This therefore involves market timing which is very risky.

There are several measures for the money supply, such as [M1](glossary://investment/M1), [M2](glossary://investment/M2), and [M3](glossary://investment/M3). The money supply is considered an important instrument for controlling inflation by those economists who say that growth in money supply will only lead to inflation if money demand is stable. In order to control the money supply, regulators have to decide which particular measure of the money supply to target. The broader the targeted measure, the more difficult it will be to control that particular target. However, targeting an unsuitable narrow money supply measure may lead to a situation where the total money supply in the country is not adequately controlled.

    desc: |-4
        [Bond](glossary://investment/Bond) issued by a state, city, or local government. Municipalities issue bonds to raise capital for their day-to-day activities and for specific projects that they might be undertaking (usually pertaining to development of local infrastructure such as roads, sewerage, hospitals etc). interest on municipal bonds are generally exempt from federal tax. In the case that the bond is bought by a resident of the state that issued the bond, the interest payments are also exempt from state tax. Interest payments are further exempt from local tax if they are bought by residents of the locality that issued the bond. [Capital gains](glossary://investment/Capital-gains) however are taxable. Given the tax-savings they offer, municipal bonds are often bought by people who have large [tax](glossary://investment/tax) burdens. [Yields](glossary://investment/Yields) on municipal bonds are often lower than corporate or [Treasury bonds](glossary://investment/Treasury-bonds) with comparable [maturities](glossary://investment/maturities), because of the important advantage of not being taxed at the federal level. In general, municipal bonds are considered safer than corporate bonds, since a municipality is far less likely to go [bankrupt](glossary://investment/bankrupt) than a company. Some municipal bonds can also be insured by outside agencies. These companies will promise to pay the interest and principal if the issuer defaults. Both issuers and bondholders can carry this insurance, though a bondholder would need to have a large stake to get the coverage. There are two common types of municipal bonds: general obligation and revenue. General Obligation (GO) bonds are unsecured municipal bonds that are simply backed by the full faith and credit of the municipality. Generally, these bonds have maturities of at least 10 years and are paid off with funds from taxes or other fees. Revenue bonds are used to fund projects that will eventually create revenue directly, such as a toll road or lease payments for a new building. The revenues from the projects are used to pay off the bonds. In some cases the issuer is not obligated to pay interest unless a certain amount of revenue is generated. Municipal bonds usually come in $5,000 par values and usually require a minimum investment of $25,000 in order to get the best price. (aka: muni)

        Options Clearing Corporation. The organization that handles clearing of the options [trades](glossary://investment/trades) for the various options exchanges and regulates the listing of new options. It is regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission, and is owned jointly by the U.S. stock exchanges that trade options (American Stock Exchange, Chicago Board Options Exchange, Pacific Exchange, and Philadelphia Stock Exchange). The fact that all listed options are cleared through OCC means that all options are free of default risk, since the OCC guarantees all option contracts. Therefore, the buyer or a seller of an option only faces the credit risk of the OCC (which is minimal), not the credit risk of the counterparty. In order to manage risk, the OCC imposes margin requirements on all options brokers. The margin requirement depends on the particulars of each specific contract.

  - name: option contract
    desc: |-4
        The right, but not the obligation, to buy (for a [call option](glossary://investment/call-option)) or sell (for a [put option](glossary://investment/put-option)) a specific amount of a given [stock](glossary://investment/stock), [commodity](glossary://investment/commodity), [currency](glossary://investment/currency), [index](glossary://investment/index), or [debt](glossary://investment/debt), at a specified price (the strike price) during a specified period of time. For stock options, the amount is usually 100 shares. Each option contract has a buyer, called the [holder](glossary://investment/holder), and a seller, known as the [writer](glossary://investment/writer). If the option contract is exercised, the writer is responsible for fulfilling the terms of the contract by delivering the [shares](glossary://investment/shares) to the appropriate party. In the case of a security that cannot be delivered such as an index, the contract is settled in [cash](glossary://investment/cash). For the holder, the potential loss is limited to the price paid to acquire the option. When an option is not exercised, it [expires](glossary://investment/expires). No shares change hands and the money spent to purchase the option is lost. For the buyer, the upside is unlimited. Option contracts, like stocks, are therefore said to have an asymmetrical payoff pattern. For the writer, the potential loss is unlimited unless the contract is covered, meaning that the writer already owns the security underlying the option. Option contracts are most frequently as either leverage or protection. As [leverage](glossary://investment/leverage), options allow the holder to control equity in a limited capacity for a fraction of what the shares would cost. The difference can be invested elsewhere until the option is exercised. As protection, options can guard against price fluctuations in the near term because they provide the right acquire the underlying stock at a fixed price for a limited time. risk is limited to the option premium (except when writing options for a security that is not already owned). However, the costs of trading options (including both commissions and the bid/ask spread) is higher on a percentage basis than trading the underlying stock. In addition, options are very complex and require a great deal of observation and maintenance.  (aka: option)

Understandably, time value approaches zero as the expiration date nears. (aka: option price)

Like common stock, preference shares represent partial ownership in a company, although preferred stock [shareholders](glossary://investment/shareholders) do not enjoy any of the voting rights of common stockholders. Also unlike common stock, preference shares pay a [fixed](glossary://investment/fixed) dividend that does not [fluctuate](glossary://investment/fluctuate), although the company does not have to pay this [dividend](glossary://investment/dividend) if it lacks the financial ability to do so. The main benefit to owning preference shares are that the [investor](glossary://investment/investor) has a greater claim on the companyâ€™s assets than common stockholders. Preferred shareholders always receive their dividends first and, in the event the company goes bankrupt, preferred shareholders are paid off before common stockholders.

PPOs may also offer more flexibility by allowing for visits to out-of-network professionals at a greater expense to the policy [holder](glossary://investment/holder). Visits within the network require only the payment of a small fee. There is often a [deductible](glossary://investment/deductible) for out-of-network expenses and a higher [co-payment](glossary://investment/co-payment). A policy holder will have a primary physician within the network who will handle referrals to specialists that will be covered by the PPO. After any visit, the policy holder must submit a claim, and will be reimbursed for the visit minus his/her co-payment.

The price persistence of a stock is calculated by taking the percentage price change of a stock over a set period of time and ranking it on a scale of 1 to 100 against all other stocks on the market, with 1 being worst and 100 being best. For example, a stock with a price persistence of 90 has experienced a greater increase in its price over the last year than the price increases experienced by 90% of all other stocks on the market. Some technical analysts, especially [momentum](glossary://investment/momentum) investors, like stocks with high price persistence rankings, believing that stocks which have recently gone up are more likely to continue going up. Other technical analysts believe that a very high price persistence can be an indication that the stock is [overbought](glossary://investment/overbought) and is ready to fall. Price persistence is really a rear view mirror metric, measuring only how the stock has done in the past, not how it will do in the future. (aka: relative strength)

A low ratio may signal a good investment opportunity, but the ratio is less meaningful for some types of companies, such as those in technology sectors. This is because such companies have hidden assets such as intellectual property which are of great value, but not reflected in the book value.

The value is the same whether the calculation is done for the whole company or on a per-share basis. A low price to sales ratio (for example, below 1.0) is usually thought to be a better investment since the [investor](glossary://investment/investor) is paying less for each unit of sales. However, sales don't reveal the whole picture, since the company might be unprofitable. Because of the limitations, price to sales ratio are usually used only for unprofitable companies, since such companies don't have a [price/earnings ratio (P/E ratio)](glossary://investment/price/earnings-ratio-(P/E-ratio)).

        A [bond](glossary://investment/bond) which the issuer has the right to [redeem](glossary://investment/redeem) prior to its [maturity](glossary://investment/maturity) date, under certain conditions. When issued, the bond will explain when it can be redeemed and what the price will be. In most cases, the price will be slightly above the [par](glossary://investment/par) value for the bond and will increase the earlier the bond is called. A company will often [call](glossary://investment/call) a bond if it is paying a higher coupon than the current market [interest rates](glossary://investment/interest-rates). Basically, the company can reissue the same bonds at a lower interest rate, saving them some amount on all the coupon payments; this process is called [refunding](glossary://investment/refunding). Unfortunately, these are also the same circumstances in which the bonds have the highest price; interest rates have decreased since the bonds were issued, increasing the price. In many cases, the company will have the right to call the bonds at a lower price than the market price. If a bond is called, the bondholder will be notified by mail and have no choice in the matter. The [bond](glossary://investment/bond) will stop paying [interest](glossary://investment/interest) shortly after the bond is called, so there is no reason to hold on to it.

For most securities, there is a certain initial time period in which the security cannot be called. A bond will usually be called when market interest rates fall below the yield being paid on the bond (bonds are usually called when the price rises to a certain point). To reflect this risk, a callable security is usually priced lower than a non-callable security. (aka: callable)

In order to decide whether this is worthwhile, the savings in interest must be weighed against the [fees](glossary://investment/fees) associated with refinancing. The difficult part of this calculation is predicting how much the up-front [money](glossary://investment/money) would be worth when the savings are received. Other reasons to refinance include reducing the term of a longer mortgage, or switching between a fixed-rate and an adjustable-rate mortgage. If there are [prepayment](glossary://investment/prepayment) fees attached to the existing mortgage, refinancing becomes less favorable because of the increased cost to the borrower at the time of the refinancing.

  - name: reinvestment date
    desc: |-4
        The first day of the ex-[dividend](glossary://investment/dividend) period. The reinvestment date was created to allow all pending transactions to be completed before the record date. If an [investor](glossary://investment/investor) does not own the [stock](glossary://investment/stock) before the reinvestment date, he or she will be ineligible for the dividend payout. Further, for all pending transactions that have not been completed by the reinvestment date, the exchanges automatically reduce the price of the [stock](glossary://investment/stock) by the amount of the dividend. This is done because a dividend payout automatically reduces the value of the company (it comes from the company's [cash reserves](glossary://investment/cash-reserves)), and the investor would have to absorb that reduction in value (because neither the buyer nor the seller are eligible for the dividend). (aka: ex-dividend date)

For example, falling [interest rates](glossary://investment/interest-rates) may prevent [bond](glossary://investment/bond) [coupon](glossary://investment/coupon) payments from earning the same rate of return as the original bond.

  - name: reinvestment
    also: Dividend Reinvestment Plan, automatic reinvestment plan, capital gains distribution, ex-dividend date

REITs are traded on major [exchanges](glossary://investment/exchanges) just like stocks. They are also granted special tax considerations. REITs offer several [benefits](glossary://investment/benefits) over actually owning properties. First, they are highly liquid, unlike traditional real estate. Second, REITs enable sharing in non-residential properties as well, such as hotels, malls, and other commercial or industrial properties. Third, there's no minimum investment with REITs. REITs do not necessarily increase and decrease in value along with the broader market. However, they pay yields in the form of [dividends](glossary://investment/dividends) no matter how the shares perform. REITs can be valued based upon fundamental measures, similar to the valuation of stocks, but different numbers tend to be important for REITs than for stocks.

  - name: Relative Strength Index
    desc: |-4
        RSI. A technical analysis indicator which measures the magnitude of gains over a given time period against the magnitude of losses over that period. The equation is RSI = 100 - 100 / (1 + RS) where RS = (total gains / n) / (total losses / n) and n = number of RSI periods. The value can range from 1 to 100. Some technical analysts believe that a value of 30 or below indicates an oversold condition and that a value of 70 or above indicates an overbought condition.

  - name: relative strength
    also: momentum, technical analysis, RSI, momo play, price persistence
    desc: |-4
        A stock's price change over a period of time relative to that of a [market index](glossary://investment/market-index), such as the [S&amp;P 500](glossary://investment/S&amp;P-500). The relative strength of a stock is calculated by taking the percentage price change of a stock over a set period of time and ranking it on a scale of 1 to 100 against all other stocks on the market, with 1 being worst and 100 being best. For example, a stock with a relative strength of 90 has experienced a greater increase in its price over the last year than the price increases experienced by 90% of all other stocks on the market. Some technical analysts, especially [momentum](glossary://investment/momentum) investors, like stocks with high relative strength rankings, believing that stocks which have recently gone up are more likely to continue going up. Other technical analysts believe that a very high relative strength can be an indication that the stock is [overbought](glossary://investment/overbought) and is ready to fall. Relative strength is really a rear view mirror metric, measuring only how the stock has done in the past, not how it will do in the future.

  - name: relative volatility

Such bonds are generally issued by municipalities, who use the [proceeds](glossary://investment/proceeds) to finance various kinds of development projects. Self-supporting bonds are sometimes named after the specific kind of project that they are financing (for example, hospital revenue bond). Municipalities might opt for a revenue bond structure in cases where they have the power to levy charges on users of the projects, such as roads, airports, or hospitals. Since a self-supporting bond is supported by project-specific revenues as opposed to more secure general [tax](glossary://investment/tax) revenues, they are of slightly lower quality than general obligation bonds, and so they tend to have higher yields. However, self-supporting bonds issued by municipalities have a good track record, and are generally considered low risk, liquid investments provided they are backed up by viable projects. Thus, the most important factor to keep in mind when investing in such bonds is the revenue prospects of the project that is being financed by the bond. Like all [municipal bonds](glossary://investment/municipal-bonds), interest earned on the bonds is exempt from federal tax. In the case that the bond is bought by a resident of the state that issued the bond, the interest payments are also [exempt](glossary://investment/exempt) from state tax. [Interest](glossary://investment/Interest) payments are further exempt from local tax if they are bought by residents of the locality that issued the bond.

Short selling (or selling short) is a technique used by investors who try to profit from the falling [price](glossary://investment/price) of a stock. For example, consider an [investor](glossary://investment/investor) who wants to sell short 100 shares of a [company](glossary://investment/company), believing it is overpriced and will fall. The investor's broker will borrow the shares from someone who owns them with the promise that the investor will return them later. The investor immediately sells the borrowed shares at the current market price. If the price of the shares drops, he/she covers the short position by buying back the shares, and his/her broker returns them to the [lender](glossary://investment/lender). The profit is the difference between the price at which the stock was sold and the cost to buy it back, minus commissions and expenses for borrowing the stock. But if the price of the shares increase, the potential losses are unlimited. The companyâ€™s shares may go up and up, but at some point the investor has to replace the 100 shares he/she sold. In that case, the losses can mount without limit until the short position is covered. For this reason, short selling is a very risky technique. [SEC](glossary://investment/SEC) rules allow investors to sell short only on an uptick or a zero-plus tick, to prevent [pool](glossary://investment/pool) operators from driving down a stock price through heavy short-selling, then buying the shares for a large [profit](glossary://investment/profit).

For example, if a company has 1000 shares of stock outstanding and a person owns 50 of them, then he/she owns 5% of the company. Most stock also provides voting rights, which give [shareholders](glossary://investment/shareholders) a proportional vote in certain corporate decisions.

    also: aggregate supply curve, demand curve
    desc: |-4
        A graph showing the hypothetical supply of a product or service that would be available at different price points.

In the short run, an increase in price will usually cause an increase in supply, but the leading producers can only manage a limited increase. However, in the longer term, new producers enter the market attracted by higher prices, and the supply at each price increases more significantly. In theory, in the most extreme cases, supply can be totally unreactive to [price](glossary://investment/price) (special cases of very uncompetitive markets), or supply can be infinite at a particular price (e.g. a highly competitive market).

At low levels of supply, supply elasticity tends to be high and it becomes less so as supply rises. This is because as supply increases, it becomes more difficult for producers to increase supply further as production approaches full capacity.

A [proportional tax](glossary://investment/proportional-tax) is one in which the percent paid as tax stays the same as the amount rises (for example, sales tax, or corporate income tax in some countries). A [regressive tax](glossary://investment/regressive-tax) is one in which the percent paid as tax falls as the amount rises (for example, value added tax in some cases). Thus, a person's applicable tax rate will depend on how much of each type of tax he/she pays as part of his/her total tax burden.

    desc: |-4
        A [fee](glossary://investment/fee) charged (levied) by a government on a product, [income](glossary://investment/income), or [activity](glossary://investment/activity). If tax is levied directly on personal or corporate income, then it is a direct tax. If tax is levied on the price of a good or service, then it is called an indirect tax. The purpose of taxation is to finance government [expenditure](glossary://investment/expenditure). One of the most important uses of taxes is to finance public goods and services, such as street lighting and street cleaning. Since public goods and services do not allow a non-payer to be excluded, or allow exclusion by a consumer, there cannot be a market in the good or service, and so they need to be provided by the government or a quasi-government agency, which tend to finance themselves largely through taxes.

    desc: |-4
        A method of evaluating securities by relying on the assumption that market data, such as charts of price, volume, and open interest, can help predict future (usually short-term) market trends. Unlike fundamental analysis, the intrinsic value of the security is not considered. Technical analysts believe that they can accurately predict the future price of a stock by looking at its historical prices and other trading variables. Technical analysis assumes that market psychology influences trading in a way that enables predicting when a stock will rise or fall. For that reason, many technical analysts are also market timers, who believe that technical analysis can be applied just as easily to the market as a whole as to an individual stock.

  - name: Treasuries
    also: yield curve
    desc: |-4
        Negotiable U.S. Government debt [obligations](glossary://investment/obligations), backed by its [full faith and credit](glossary://investment/full-faith-and-credit). [Exempt](glossary://investment/Exempt) from state and local taxes. Treasuries are issued by the U.S. government in order to pay for government projects. The money paid out for a Treasury bond is essentially a loan to the government. As with any loan, repayment of principal is accompanied by a specified interest rate. These bonds are guaranteed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government, meaning that they are extremely low [risk](glossary://investment/risk) (since the government can simply print money to pay back the loan). Additionally, interest earned on Treasuries is exempt from state and local taxes. Federal taxes, however, are still due on the earned [interest](glossary://investment/interest). The government sells Treasuries by auction in the [primary market](glossary://investment/primary-market), but they are marketable securities and therefore can be purchased through a [broker](glossary://investment/broker) in the very active [secondary market](glossary://investment/secondary-market). A broker will charge a [fee](glossary://investment/fee) for such a transaction, but the government charges no fee to participate in auctions. Prices on the secondary market and at auction are determined by interest rates. Treasuries issued today are not callable, so they will continue to accrue interest until the maturity date. One possible downside to Treasuries is that if interest rates increase during the term of the bond, the money invested will be earning less interest than it could earn elsewhere. Accordingly, the resale value of the bond will decrease as well. Because there is almost no risk of default by the government, the return on Treasury bonds is relatively low, and a high [inflation rate](glossary://investment/inflation-rate) can erase most of the gains by reducing the value of the principal and interest payments. There are three types of securities issued by the U.S. Treasury ([bonds](glossary://investment/bonds), [bills](glossary://investment/bills), and [notes](glossary://investment/notes)), which are distinguished by the amount of time from the initial sale of the bond to [maturity](glossary://investment/maturity).

Interest is paid semi-annually. Treasury bonds are exempt from state and local taxes. These securities have the longest maturity of any bond issued by the [U.S. Treasury](glossary://investment/U.S.-Treasury), from 10 to 30 years. The 30-year bond is also called the long bond. Denominations range from $1000 to $1 million. Treasury bonds pay [interest](glossary://investment/interest) every 6 months at a fixed coupon rate. These bonds are not callable, but some older Treasury bonds available on the secondary market are callable within five years of the maturity date. (aka: U)S. Treasury bond or T-bond.

  - name: Uniform Gift to Minors Act

    desc: |-4
        UGMA. Laws adopted by most states allowing an adult to contribute to a [custodial account](glossary://investment/custodial-account) in a minor's name without having to establish a trust or name a legal guardian. Thus, minors can have securities bought and money invested in their names, but the custodian is responsible for managing the [funds](glossary://investment/funds) in the account. The [custodian](glossary://investment/custodian) has a fiduciary duty to manage the account prudently, but once the minor reaches the age of majority, he/she has complete rights to the funds in the account. The assets are the legal property of the minor, and the parent has no [legal](glossary://investment/legal) control over the uses of the proceeds of the account. All withdrawals from the account are taxed at the minor's rate. Putting money into a UGMA account can negatively impact the chances for financial aid, since financial aid officers weigh children's assets much more heavily than parents' assets.

[Capital gains](glossary://investment/Capital-gains), interest and [dividend](glossary://investment/dividend) payments from the trust are passed on to [shareholders](glossary://investment/shareholders) at regular periods. If the trust is one that invests only in tax-free securities, then the income from the trust is also tax-free. A unit investment trust is generally considered a low-risk, low-return investment. Some investors prefer UITs to mutual funds because UITs typically incur lower annual operating expenses (since they are not buying and selling shares); however, UITs often have sales charges and entrance/exit fees. (aka: fixed investment trust or participating trust or unit trust)

  - name: universal life
    also: whole life, variable life, variable universal life
    desc: |-4
        [Life insurance](glossary://investment/Life-insurance) which combines the low-cost protection of term insurance with a savings component that is invested in a tax-deferred account, the [cash value](glossary://investment/cash-value) of which may be available for a loan to the [policyholder](glossary://investment/policyholder). Universal life was created to provide more flexibility than whole life by allowing the holder to shift [money](glossary://investment/money) between the [insurance](glossary://investment/insurance) and [savings](glossary://investment/savings) components of the policy. Additionally, the inner workings of the investment process are openly displayed to the holder, whereas details of whole life investments tend to be quite scarce. [Premiums](glossary://investment/Premiums), which are variable, are broken down by the insurance company into insurance and savings. Therefore, the holder can adjust the proportions of the policy based on external conditions. If the savings are earning a poor return, they can be used to pay the premiums instead of injecting more money. If the holder remains insurable, more of the premium can be applied to insurance, increasing the death benefit. Unlike with whole life, the cash value investments grow at a variable rate that is adjusted monthly. There is usually a minimum [rate of return](glossary://investment/rate-of-return). These changes to the interest scheme allow the holder to take advantage of rising interest rates. The danger is that falling [interest rates](glossary://investment/interest-rates) may cause premiums to increase and even cause the policy to lapse if interest can no longer pay a portion of the insurance costs.
