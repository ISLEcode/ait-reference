        Gartner defines **ultra-high-speed broadband Internet** as residential services that support download speeds of more than
        50 Mbps.

        An **ultrabook** is a specific type of ultramobile notebook, defined by Intel. Ultrabooks are thin, lightweight and offer
        longer battery life by utilizing new low-power CPUs integrated with instant-on capability, all without compromising
        performance. Although Intel is likely to update its requirements for what constitutes an Ultrabook, it currently has the
        following attributes: less than 21-mm thick, instant-on, minimum battery life of five hours, security features, a screen
        size of 11 inches or more, and Intel processors based on Ivy Bridge architecture.

    term : Ultracapacitors

    desc : |-4
        **Ultracapacitors** use nanomaterials to store a static charge on either side of a vast surface area of insulating
        material. The voltages are low, but the charge density is high. Ultracapacitors exceed lead-acid energy densities, and lab
        units far exceed the capacity of conventional batteries. The technology continues to evolve, as energy storage capacity
        increases and costs decrease. For the data center, we expect ultracapacitors to become an option to replace batteries as
        the backup power source for an uninterruptible power supply (UPS).

    term : Unified Communications And Collaboration (UCC)

        **Unified communications and collaboration (UCC)** describes the combination of communications and collaboration
        technologies. Until recently, enterprise collaboration vendors were fairly distinct from those for enterprise
        communications, with software companies like Microsoft and IBM dominating the former and telephony and networking vendors
        comprising the latter. However, this distinction has become blurred because Microsoft and IBM offer voice and telephony
        features and vendors like Cisco have moved into the collaboration market.

    term : Unified Communications Products
    abbr :
    from : ITIL glossary (2013)
    desc : |-4
        Gartner defines **unified communications products** (equipment, software and services) as those that facilitate the
        interactive use of multiple enterprise communications methods. This can include control, management and integration of
        these methods. UC products integrate communications channels (media), networks and systems, as well as IT business
        applications and, in some cases, consumer applications and devices.

    desc : |-4
        **Unified threat management (UTM)** is a converged platform of point security products, particularly suited to small and
        midsize businesses (SMBs). Typical feature sets fall into three main subsets, all within the UTM: firewall/intrusion
        prevention system (IPS)/virtual private network, secure Web gateway security (URL filtering, Web antivirus \[AV\]) and
        messaging security (anti-spam, mail AV).

    term : URL (uniform Resource Locator)
    abbr :
    from : ITIL glossary (2013)
    desc : |-4
        A **URL (uniform resource locator)** is the character string that identifies an Internet document's exact name and
        location.

    term : User Authentication Technologies
    abbr :
    from : ITIL glossary (2013)
    desc : |-4
        **User authentication technologies** encompass a variety of products and services implementing a range of authentication
        methods in place of legacy passwords. Methods are typically classified by the kind of authentication attributes (or
        factors) that they use, alone or in combination: something known, something held (a token) or something inherent (a
        biometric characteristic). Authentication may be natively supported in products or services (including other security
        tools), or provided by discrete software, hardware or cloud-based services.

    term : User Experience Platforms (UXP)
    abbr :
    from : ITIL glossary (2013)
    desc : |-4
        A **user experience platform (UXP)** is an integrated set of technologies used to provide interaction between a user and a
        set of applications, processes, content, services or other users. A UXP has several components, including portals, mashup
        tools, content management, search, rich Internet application (RIA) tools, analytics, collaboration, social and mobile
        tools. It may be delivered as a suite of products or as a single product. The UXP market will fully emerge in 2013, seeded
        by the existing suite-oriented horizontal portal vendors.

    term : User Provisioning
    abbr :
    from : ITIL glossary (2013)
    desc : |-4
        **User provisioning** or account provisioning technology creates, modifies, disables and deletes user accounts and their
        profiles across IT infrastructure and business applications. Provisioning tools use approaches such as cloning, roles and
        business rules so businesses can automate onboarding, off-boarding and other administration workforce processes (for
        example, new hires, transfers, promotions and terminations). Provisioning tools also automatically aggregate and correlate
        identity data from HR, CRM, email systems and other "identity stores." Fulfillment is initiated via self-service,
        management request or HR system changes. Regulatory compliance and security efficiencies continue to drive most
        user-provisioning implementations.
