        Gartner's **MarketScopes** rate vendors based on criteria that focuses on the important aspects of an emerging or mature
        market. In emerging markets, vendors and products are less well known or tested in the market, and it would be difficult
        to analyze all criteria typically used in a Magic Quadrant. In mature markets, vendors and products are typically well
        known, and demand for relative comparison shifts to a focus on differentiating criteria. By focusing on a limited set of
        criteria for these markets, MarketScopes will help you understand the dynamics of the market as well as the strengths of
        its vendors, even when the market is not well suited for Magic Quadrant analysis.

        Gartner sees the term **master content management (MCM)** being used in two distinct senses: 1) MCM is the workflow
        process in which business and IT work together to ensure the uniformity, accuracy, stewardship and accountability of the
        enterprise's official, shared information assets; in this case, content assets, such as employee, supplier and customer
        contracts, new customer intake forms and other content types that must be managed as enterprise information. 2) MCM is a
        consistent, official set of identifiers, attributes and taxonomies applied to unstructured information. As such it can be
        implemented in any content management system and linked to a master data management (MDM) application.

        A **message broker** is a logical hub that copies and resends messages to one or more destinations. As a value-adding
        third party between information sources and information consumers, it can complement a service-oriented architecture
        (SOA). Like an SOA, a broker is a design abstraction that may be implemented using component software for some or all of
        the connections. The interface from a message broker to the application may use an object request broker (ORB) or object
        transaction monitor (OTM); a request to the message broker may be implemented as a series of method calls to participating
        components.

        **Message passing** refers to services performing a simple, one-way transfer operation between two programs. Like the
        other one-way messaging models, message passing generally leaves the sending program unblocked. Also, as with all forms of
        messaging, message passing is usually connectionless, which means that the sending application does not have to explicitly
        establish and manage a connection with the message's intended recipient. Although message passing is not inherently a
        two-way communication model, two-way communication can be accomplished by sending the response in a separate message.

        **Micro fuel cells** are an alternative to batteries as a power source for mobile devices. They may be small enough for
        integration inside the electronic equipment, or a little larger for use in an external power supply. The majority of
        portable fuel cells use hydrogen as the base fuel, but micro fuel cells usually extract it from methanol--a hydrogen-rich
        liquid. Although methanol-based cells can potentially provide 10 times the energy storage capacity of a lithium battery,
        they are not as good at delivering bursts of high power. This makes them more useful for battery charging than for primary
        power roles. They can be recharged almost instantaneously by adding more methanol--by either pouring it in or clipping in
        a new cartridge. This is a significant advantage over batteries, which can take several hours to recharge. Micro fuel
        cells are also environmentally friendly; the operating waste is only hydrogen and oxygen, which appears (in the form of
        pure water) as slightly increased humidity around the cell. Other forms of fuel cell, such as zinc-air and ethanol, are
        possible fuel sources for mobile devices--but are currently less prominent.

        **Mobile satellite services (MSS)** provide two-way voice and data communications to global users who are on the go or in
        remote locations; terminals range in size from handheld to laptop-size units. Terminals can also be mounted in a vehicle,
        with communications maintained while the vehicle is moving. MSS operates at L-band--low enough in the frequency spectrum
        to avoid the rain fade associated with higher bandwidth Ku- and Ka-band fixed satellite systems. (Note: Ku and Ka bands
        are used for a limited set of similar applications, but typically have much larger terminals; more focused beams also
        result in the need for the terminal to track the satellite.)
