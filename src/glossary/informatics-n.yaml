        An**N-channel metal-oxide semiconductor (NMOS)** is a microelectronic circuit used for logic and memory chips and in
        complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) design. NMOS transistors are faster than the P-channel metal-oxide
        semiconductor (PMOS) counterpart, and more of them can be put on a single chip.

        **Nanography** is a digital printing process developed by Landa Digital Printing that employs a combination of offset,
        inkjet and nanotechnologies to print on virtually any paper or film. The name is derived from Landa's colorants (inks),
        which have pigment particles measured in the tens of nanometers.

    term : Nanomaterial Supercapacitors
    abbr :
    from : ITIL glossary (2013)
    desc : |-4
        A capacitor is a passive electronic component that stores electrical energy in an electrostatic field. This is unlike a
        battery, which stores energy in a chemical form. Capacitors are formed from two conducting plates separated by an
        insulator. The amount of capacitance is proportional to the surface areas of the plates, and inversely proportional to the
        separation between the plates. **Nanomaterial supercapacitors ** use nanomaterials, which dramatically increases the
        surface area and the amount of energy that can be stored.

    desc : |-4
        **Nanotubes** are tiny cylinders of atoms that can be used for a wide variety of purposes because of their electrical or
        mechanical properties. Different properties and different forces apply at the nanoscale level when compared with macro or
        "real world" dimensions. These differences exhibit themselves in the form of high electrical conductivity, great
        mechanical strength and other properties. The main focus in electronics is on carbon nanotubes. These can be as small as
        10 atoms in diameter. Different nanotubes can have insulating, conducting or semiconducting properties. Carbon nanotubes
        with semiconductor properties offer the promise of small transistors with high switching speeds. Carbon nanotubes with
        metallic (conducting) properties offer the promise of low electrical resistance that can be applied to the
        interconnections within integrated circuits. Other nanotube materials being evaluated include silicon and compound
        semiconductor materials.

    desc : |-4
        Often called a "thin client," a network computer is a limited-function desktop computer that is designed to easily connect
        to networks. NCs include a keyboard, mouse, monitor, memory and a network connection but only limited, if any, local disk
        storage. When end users want to access software or databases using an NC, they would use a graphical user interface (GUI),
        much as they do now with a PC. However, the software would be downloaded from a central server instead of being resident
        on the desktop PC; large databases would also be maintained on the central server. All software backups, upgrades and
        maintenance would therefore be performed centrally on the network server.

    desc : |-4
        A **net-liberated organization (NLO)** is a Gartner concept describing an organizational philosophy enabled by the advent
        of the Internet and related Web technologies. Rather than "bolting on" Web initiatives to mainstream operations (i.e.,
        integrating the Internet into business processes, but leaving the structure of these processes intact), an NLO uses these
        technologies to liberate itself from the constraints of traditional business environments that focus on local and physical
        infrastructures.

        The goal of an NLO is to transform the enterprise into one that is more agile, and thus better able to meet customer
        demands.

    desc : |-4
        Network outsourcing is a multiyear or annuity contract/relationship involving the purchase of ongoing network or telecom
        management services for managing, enhancing, maintaining and supporting premises or core network infrastructure or
        enterprise telecommunications assets (including fixed and wireless). In addition to network or telecommunications
        management, network outsourcing isolates those services specifically delivered in a longer-term contract in support of
        network infrastructures: consulting/advisory services, network AD and integration, network infrastructure deployment and
        support services.

        Gartner segments network outsourcing into two categories: enterprise network outsourcing and public network outsourcing.
        Enterprise network outsourcing does not include discrete, project-based professional services or staff augmentation
        services. Also, enterprise network outsourcing does not include services related to the physical cable plant or other
        facilities-related services (such as power conditioning). For public network outsourcing, we include services related to
        the carrier network, business and operations support systems. Internal ITO is not considered, nor are services related to
        public network facilities and logistics planning (for example, DC power, land acquisition and tower placement). Similarly,
        discrete, project-based professional services or staff augmentation services (commonly referred to as
        engineer-furnish-install) are not included in public network outsourcing.

        Any number of computers (e.g., PCs and servers) and devices (e.g., printers and modems) joined together by a physical
        communications link. In the enterprise context, networks allow information to be passed between computers, irrespective of
        where those computers are located. Networks provide the roads for information traffic (e.g., sending files and e-mail)
        within a corporate environment, and allow users to access databases and share applications residing on servers. If a
        network does not go outside of a company building, or campus, then it is known as a local-area network (LAN). If it has a
        bridge to other outside networks, usually via lines owned by public telecommunications carriers like AT&T, then it is
        known as a wide-area network (WAN).
