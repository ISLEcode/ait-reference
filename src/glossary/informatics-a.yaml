    desc : |-4
        **Absorption chillers** use a different mechanism from traditional chillers, and are powered by heat rather than using
        electricity, potentially resulting in significant efficiency gains. The cooling mechanism is still evaporative -- a liquid
        transforming into a vapor -- but the reliquification is different. Instead of being compressed, the vapor is absorbed into
        another liquid. The classic cycle here uses ammonia, which is absorbed into water.

        An **access method** is:

        The portion of a computer's operating system responsible for formatting data sets and their direction to specific storage
        devices. Examples from the mainframe world include Virtual Storage Access Method (VSAM) and Indexed Sequential Access
        Method (ISAM).

        In local-area networks, the technique or program code used to arbitrate the use of the communications medium by granting
        access selectively to individual stations. Examples are Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection (CSMA-CD)
        and token passing.

        **Accountable care organization (ACO)** is an umbrella term for a major switch in contracting between providers and public
        or private payers. In an ACO model, a group of providers, operating as a legal entity, contracts to assume some portion of
        the risk for cost and quality for a panel of beneficiaries through a variety of value-based payment models over a
        specified period of time. ACOs include primary care services. The U.S. CMS Distributed Shared Savings Program, which began
        operation in 2012, is one version of this model.

        **Active Directory** is the "directory service" portion of the Windows 2000 operating system. Active Directory manages the
        identities and relationships of the distributed resources that make up a network environment. It stores information about
        network-based entities (e.g., applications, files, printers and people) and provides a consistent way to name, describe,
        locate, access, manage and secure information about these resources. It the central authority that manages the identities
        and brokers the relationships between these distributed resources, enabling them to work together.

    desc : |-4
        **Active matrix organic light-emitting diodes (AMOLEDs)** consist of pixels of electroluminescent organic compounds
        "printed" in a matrix onto a base layer. This base layer is currently glass and will be further developed to use flexible
        polymers in the future. Unlike liquid crystal displays, OLED displays do not require a backlight and consume very little
        power, making them suitable for battery-powered devices. AMOLEDs use a thin film transistor (TFT) to control the pixels.

        **ActiveX** is an application programming interface (API) that enhances Microsoft's OLE protocol. Often compared to Java,
        ActiveX facilitates various Internet applications, and therefore extends and enhances the functionality of Microsoft's
        Internet Explorer browser. Like Java, ActiveX enables the development of interactive content. When an ActiveX-aware
        browser encounters a Web page that includes an unfamiliar feature, it automatically installs the appropriate applications
        so the feature can be used.

        **Activity-Based Costing (ABC)** is an improved approach to understanding where and why costs are incurred within an
        enterprise. It provides the information for activity-based management, which focuses on the decisions and actions needed
        to reduce costs and increase revenue. ABC differs from traditional cost accounting in explicitly recognizing that not all
        cost objects place an equal demand on support resources.

    desc : |-4
        An **activity stream** is a publish-and-subscribe notification mechanism and conversation space typically found in social
        networking. It lists activities or events relevant to a person, group, topic or everything in the environment. A
        participant subscribes to, or "follows" entities (e.g., other participants or business application objects) to track their
        related activities. For example, a project management application may add status information, while a physical object
        connected to the Internet may report its state (e.g., tunnel lane closure).

    term : Adapters
    abbr :
    from : ITIL glossary (2013)
    desc : |-4
        **Adapters** are small, focused programs that expose functionality and/or data in a legacy application. Our use of this
        term includes not only the programs, but also the framework for designing and developing adapter programs. Adapters can be
        deceptively complex, with "thick" adapters performing a variety of functions that include recognizing events, collecting
        and transforming data, and exchanging data with platform, integration suite or other middleware. However, "thin" adapters
        may only "wrap" a native application interface, exposing another more-standard one for application access. Adapters can
        also handle exception conditions and can often dynamically (or with minor reconfiguration) accommodate new revisions of
        source or target applications.

        Adapters are often sold in conjunction with integration middleware products, such as ESBs, integration suites or portal
        servers, or are offered as a stand-alone product, such as an adapter suite. Among the different adapters, high-level
        categories include technical and application adapters.

        A comprehensive suite should include adapters for:

        Common technologies, such as COM, Enterprise JavaBeans and Web services

        Industry protocols, such as EDI, Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication and RosettaNet

        Common applications, such as SAP or PeopleSoft

        Proprietary applications, such as an adapter development kit

    desc : |-4
        **Adaptive learning** in its fundamental form is a learning methodology that changes the pedagogical approach toward a
        student based on the student's input and a predefined response. Adaptive learning more recently is being associated with a
        large-scale collection of learning data and statistically based pedagogical responses and can be seen as a subset of
        personalized learning that includes such approaches as affective and somatic computing.

        **Addressable TV advertising** technologies enable advertisers to selectively segment TV audiences and serve different ads
        or ad pods (groups of ads) within a common program or navigation screen. Segmentation can occur at geographic,
        demographic, behavioral and (in some cases) self-selected individual household levels, through cable, satellite and
        Internet Protocol television (IPTV) delivery systems and set-top boxes (STBs).

        **Adsorption chillers** use a different mechanism than traditional chillers and are powered by heat, rather than using
        electricity. The cooling mechanism is still evaporative -- water transforming into a vapor -- but the reliquification is
        different. Instead of being compressed, the water vapor is adsorbed onto the surface of another medium, such as silica
        gel. Once the silica gel is saturated with water, it is switched out and the first chamber is then heated to remove the
        adsorbed moisture, so the chamber can be reused.

    desc : |-4
        Energy consumption in individual data centers is increasing rapidly, by 8% to 12% per year. The energy is used for
        powering IT systems (for example, servers, storage and networking equipment) and the facility's components (for example,
        air-conditioning systems, power distribution units and uninterruptible power supply systems). The increase in energy
        consumption is driven by users installing more equipment, and by the increasing power requirements of high-density server
        architectures. While data center infrastructure management (DCIM) tools monitor and model energy use across the data
        center, server-based energy management software tools are specifically designed to measure the energy use within server
        units. They are normally an enhancement to existing server management tools, such as HP Systems Insight Manager (HP SIM)
        or IBM Systems Director. These software tools are critical to gaining accurate and real-time measurements of the amount of
        energy a particular server is using. This information can then be fed into a reporting tool or into a broader DCIM
        toolset. The information will also be an important trigger for the real-time changes that will drive real-time
        infrastructure. Hence, for example, a change in energy consumption may drive a process to move an application from one
        server to another.

        **Advanced Web services** use Web services standard capabilities that go beyond those that have become commonplace. The
        original definition referred to any Web-services-related standards beyond the basic SOAP, WSDL and UDDI capabilities.
        However, the advent of the Web Services Interoperability (WS-I) Organization profiles and the common acceptance of
        standards, such as WS-Security, BPEL and related components, mean that those capabilities, once considered advanced, are
        now part of the basic Web services bundle.Basic Web services have reached the Plateau of Productivity, and are in
        widespread and common use in a variety of situations. The truly advanced Web services capabilities deal with complex
        security interactions, such as WS-Trust and WS-Federation, as well as asynchronous behavior, such as WS-ReliableMessaging.
        Web services using these types of advanced standards have been adopted more slowly, in part due to the slow pace of the
        ratification of the standards and rollout of their behavior (see "'That's All' for Web Services" G00209765), and in part
        because many of the interactions using Web services don't require these capabilities or use other methods to achieve
        them.This definition of advanced Web services is a change from the definition used in earlier Hype Cycles, and more
        accurately represents the current state of these capabilities. Because of this change, the position and speed of adoption
        have also shifted.

        "assembled" into an application (business service), possibly with a new user interface (generally portal-based, using Web
        services). Organizations can generally use AMD composition models to generate the specifications for use by workflow
        orchestration technologies in the runtime environment.

        AMD development assumes that new organizations need to develop software services prior to composition. AMD development
        tools can reuse the same business models developed by those doing AMD composition. But, generally, IT personnel refine
        these into more detailed models to generate as much of the code as possible -- 70% to 100% -- depending on the service
        type. AMD also includes the set of methods that promote "executable" models (that is, where there is no explicit
        transformation to implementation).

        An **application server** is a modern form of platform middleware. It is system software that resides between the
        operating system (OS) on one side, the external resources (such as a database management system \[DBMS\], communications
        and Internet services) on another side and the users' applications on the third side. The function of the application
        server is to act as host (or container) for the user's business logic while facilitating access to and performance of the
        business application. The application server must perform despite the variable and competing traffic of client requests,
        hardware and software failures, the distributed nature of the larger-scale applications, and potential heterogeneity of
        data and processing resources required to fulfill the business requirements of the applications.

        A high-end online-transaction-processing-style application server delivers business applications with guaranteed levels of
        performance, availability and integrity. An application server also supports multiple application design patterns,
        according to the nature of the business application and the practices in the particular industry for which the application
        has been designed. It typically supports multiple programming languages and deployment platforms, although most have a
        particular affinity to one or two of these. Some application servers that implement standard application interfaces and
        protocols, such as Java Enterprise Edition (Java EE), are entirely proprietary. At present, the proprietary application
        servers are typically built into OSs, packaged applications, such as portals and e-commerce solutions, or other products
        and are not offered as stand-alone products. Proprietary and Java EE-compliant application servers are estimated in our
        Market Share and Forecast reports.

        As the application server market matures, high performance becomes a stronger criterion, and thus where vendors now
        incorporate extensions to application servers, such as extreme transaction processing and event-based processing
        capabilities, these are also included in this market segment.

    desc : |-4
        A wide-area network (WAN) technology, **asynchronous transfer mode (ATM)** is a transfer mode for switching and
        transmission that efficiently and flexibly organizes information into cells; it is asynchronous in the sense that the
        recurrence of cells depends on the required or instantaneous bit rate. Thus, empty cells do not go by when data is
        waiting. ATM's powerful flexibility lies in its ability to provide a high-capacity, low-latency switching fabric for all
        types of information, including data, video, image and voice, that is protocol-, speed- and distance-independent. ATM
        supports fixed-length cells 53 bytes in length and virtual data circuits between 45 megabits per second (Mbps) and 622
        Mbps. Using statistical multiplexing, cells from many different sources are multiplexed onto a single physical circuit.
        The fixed-length fields in the cell, which include routing information used by the network, ensure that faster processing
        speeds are enabled using simple hardware circuits. The greatest benefit of ATM is its ability to provide support for a
        wide range of communications services while providing transport independence from those services.

        **Automated backup** delivers the most basic form of storage availability -- recoverable data. Most enterprises are
        struggling with the implementation of this function. It is a conceptually complex and labor-intensive process. Backup
        design must address multiple elements (e.g., hardware, network, file system and application) across heterogeneous
        platforms and geographically dispersed sites. Labor intensive, departmental processes are replaced with automated,
        enterprise-level solutions to increase availability.

    abbr :
    from : ITIL glossary (2013)
    desc : |-4
        **Automated business process discovery (ABPD)** as a complementary approach overcomes many of these shortcomings to create
        a business process model at a fraction of the time and cost involved in the traditional way. One major benefit of ABPD is
        process discovery across the "white space," the process knowledge gap that exists between departments and functions and at
        the edges of processes. Modeling can be done by hand, so there may be no cash-flow impact, unlike ABPD, where a tool is
        necessary. By observing the details of how processes are executed in the supporting technology, ABPD uses unstructured,
        event-level data to automatically build process definitions and models, and explore process variations. Because of the
        quantitative nature of this data, the derived process models enable rich and interactive analysis. ABPD techniques start
        from event logs (audit trails, messages, transactions, databases and so forth), and try to discover patterns to fit a
        process model to the information obtained from the events. The underlying techniques are strong enough so that users don't
        have to specify a process model; it is created from scratch by pattern recognition. Moreover, ABPD delivers information on
        bottlenecks, variances, root causes and the distribution of the process instances, thus enabling meaningful simulation.
        It's all about capturing what has happened in a real-life process. ABPD is a form of process optimization. Of course, ABPD
        does not capture informal human tasks that are not automated and represented as events in an audit trail or transaction
        log. This is why ABPD is best combined with techniques from social BPM and BPA for the masses. However, ABPD accelerates
        process discovery and identifies previously unseen process patterns. Planners must still conduct interviews to capture
        informal work practices, but organizations no longer need to spend as much time using interviews to discover the implicit
        processes previously hidden in automated solutions.

        **Auto-tiering** is a quality of storage service feature that enables logical volumes or LUNs to span different tiers of
        storage and transparently move portions of the logical volume between tiers of storage to minimize storage costs and
        deliver consistent performance and throughput. The movement of sub-LUNs between tiers is managed by auto-tiering
        algorithms and/or policy. This makes it practical to reduce the storage costs of applications without redesigning them to
        make them storage-aware, and it avoids the onerous task of doing data classification. Typical implementations support
        storage tiers built with solid-state disks (SSDs), Fibre Channel (FC) or Serial-Attached Small Computer System Interface
        (SAS SCSI), and Serial Advanced Technology Attachment (SATA) or nearline disks, and may include restrictions on the
        movement of sub-LUNs between different tiers of storage.
