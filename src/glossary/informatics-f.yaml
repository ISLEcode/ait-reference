    desc : |-4
        **Fabric-based computing (FBC)** is a modular form of computing in which a system can be aggregated from separate (or
        disaggregated) building-block modules connected over a fabric or switched backplane. Fabric-based infrastructure (FBI)
        differs from FBC by enabling existing technology elements to be grouped and packaged in a fabric-enabled environment,
        while the technology elements of an FBC solution will be designed solely around the fabric implementation model.

    desc : |-4
        **Fabric-based infrastructure (FBI)** is an emerging area of vertical integration of hardware and software infrastructure
        with automation on top, promised to assist IT organizations in realizing their visions of a dynamically optimized data
        center, which we term "real-time infrastructure." It is being driven more from a vendor perspective today (versus a
        customer pull model) as vendors seek to take a larger share of the IT budget to meet their growth goals in an era of
        constrained IT budgets. The automation layer, at a minimum, focuses on automating infrastructure provisioning inclusive of
        server, storage and networking resources, inclusive of Internet Protocol (IP) address automation and storage naming, with
        some providers also focused on enabling hybrid cloud environments between their customers and service providers, and
        provisioning the software stack above the hypervisor and operating environments. FBI differs from fabric-based computing
        (FBC) by enabling existing technology elements to be grouped and packaged in a fabric-enabled environment to achieve a
        modicum of infrastructure convergence.

    term : Factory Scheduling
    abbr :
    from : ITIL glossary (2013)
    desc : |-4
        **Factory or production scheduling** , often termed finite scheduling or finite capacity scheduling (FCS), is a supply
        chain planning (SCP) technology designed to translate an operating plan into a granular set of daily manufacturing
        activities to fulfill planned orders. Supporting technology dissects the operating plan into specific work processes,
        optimizing the allocation of production resources against ongoing change and constraints to produce to the daily schedule.
        Traditionally, these applications have been batch-centric: Planning data is input daily, schedules are created in
        batch-planning cycles overnight, and changes between planning cycles are handled manually. Today, some factory scheduling
        tools can take current constraints, including resource (physical assets and raw materials) and appropriate staff
        availability, into account, interfacing back to planning systems so that they are continuously optimized based on the
        actual expected production.

        1.Entering into an agreement with a service supplier to manage internal company facilities such as telecommunications or
        data-processing services. Facilities management does not involve the transfer of ownership of facilities to the service
        provider.

        2.For government enterprises, FM is the most prevalent type of contractual relationship where the vendor assumes
        responsibility for one or more information technology (IT) functions. Unlike outsourcing, it refers to the vendor
        operating and managing the assets (usually hardware and software), but not taking ownership. In a government-owned,
        contractor-operated deal, the government owns the equipment and operating systems, and the contractor operates the
        equipment with its personnel. Usually, the equipment is maintained in a government facility, but it can reside in a
        vendor-owned facility. In a government-owned, government-operated arrangement, the government owns the equipment and
        manages the operation using contractor personnel.

    desc : |-4
        **Folksonomies** also known as social tagging, are user-defined metadata collections. Users do not deliberately create
        folksonomies and there is rarely a prescribed purpose, but a folksonomy evolves when many users create or store content at
        particular sites and identify what they think the content is about. "Tag clouds" pinpoint various identifiers and the
        frequency of use on a folksonomy site. This type of grass-roots community classification (similar to other social
        networking approaches, such as blogs and wikis) is subject to vandalism and manipulation; nevertheless, it is a fine
        example of collective intelligence.Do not confuse folksonomies with taxonomies. Folksonomies structure content via user
        tags; taxonomies are classifications defined by more formal methods that do not necessarily include user-generated tags
        and rarely are viewed as similar.

        **"Free cooling,"** refers to any technique used to reduce the energy consumed by cooling systems or the time that the
        cooling units run by using the outside temperature of air or water to cool the data center or other facilities. Generally,
        it comes from the use of air-side and water-side economizers.Air-side economizers work in two ways. Mainly, they use
        direct fresh-air cooling by filtering (and possibly adjusting the humidity of) outside air, which is piped in to cool the
        data center. In cold climates, it may even be warmed by the hot air being expelled, so as not to be too cold. Air-side
        economizers can also work without bringing direct air into the data center, but by heat transference from warmer inside
        air to cooler outside air.

        the system is increased without increasing its allocated bandwidth. Frequency reuse schemes require sufficient isolation
        among the signals that use the same frequencies so that mutual interference among them is controlled at an acceptable
        level. For satellites, frequency reuse can be achieved by using orthogonal polarization states for transmission and/or by
        using satellite antenna (spot) beams that serve separate, non-overlapping geographic regions. See also spot beam.

        **Frequency** is an expression of how frequently a periodic wave form or signal repeats itself at a given amplitude. It
        can be expressed in hertz (Hz), kilohertz (kHz), megahertz (MHz), etc.

        A Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) standard used to log onto a network, list directories and copy
        files. That is, it provides authentication of the user and lets users transfer files, list directories, delete and rename
        files on the foreign host, and perform wild-card transfers.

    from : ITIL glossary (2013)
    desc : |-4
        FTTH includes fiber-optic access solutions designed for residential deployments. In FTTH networks, fibers are directly
        connected to individual homes or multitenant buildings. FTTH includes various flavors of both PONs and PTP Ethernet-based
        solutions. Fiber-to-the-node (FTTN) solutions where fibers are not installed all the way to the residential premises are
        not included in the FTTH segment. FTTN solutions are instead tracked according to the technology used in the last mile
        (typically VDSL). With FTTH solutions, the "in-house" connectivity may be based on fiber, coaxial cable, copper or
        wireless technologies. FTTH covers only the electronics associated with the FTTH rollouts; it excludes associated cabling
        and civil works.

    term : FTTP (fiber To The Premises)
    abbr :
    from : ITIL glossary (2013)
    desc : |-4
        The term residential fiber to the premises (FTTP) refers to equipment used in fiber access deployments where fibers extend
        all the way to the end-user premises and the equipment is designed and optimized for use in residential applications.
        Equipment designed and optimized for fiber-to-the-business applications is not included -- such equipment is included in
        the optical transport segment.

        FTTP is further divided into point-to-point (PTP) FTTP and point-to-multipoint FTTP. PTP FTTP technologies are more
        expensive to deploy because of a higher fiber count, but have the advantage of offering a dedicated fiber to each end-user
        location, which makes it possible to share PTP infrastructure between different carriers. Very often, a PTP FTTP
        deployment has optical Ethernet switches both at the CO and the customer premises. Point-to-multipoint FTTP technology is
        commonly referred to as passive optical network (PON) technology. There are various types, including broadband PON (BPON),
        gigabit PON (GPON) and Ethernet PON (EPON). GPON is the most popular for large carriers, although there are significant
        EPON deployments in Asia/Pacific and Japan. The different types of PON are collectively called xPON.

        FTTP, FTTH, fiber to the x (FTTx) and other similar terms are often used interchangeably in literature on this topic.

    desc : |-4
        Technology for low-cost miniature battery power supplies. As with batteries, fuel cells generate electricity through a
        chemical reaction. However, fuel cells are recharged by refilling or replacing the chemicals (examples include hydrogen,
        methyl alcohol or aluminum mixed with oxygen from the air) instead of plugging a charger into a wall socket. Fuel cells
        deliver energy density many times that of lithium and can power sophisticated devices longer. Choosing a stable fuel
        source that is safe and readily available and decreasing the size for smaller devices while maintaining efficiency remain
        challenges.

    term : Functional Programming Languages

    from : ITIL glossary (2013)
    desc : |-4
        The precise definition of a **functional programming language** is often a hotly debated topic among computer scientists,
        but it is generally accepted that such languages emphasize the value of expressions, rather than the execution of
        commands. These languages enable the programmer to think like a mathematician by emphasizing data over state. Functional
        programming techniques (and the supporting languages, e.g., LISP) have existed virtually since the dawn of computer
        science, but they have been largely overshadowed by imperative languages (e.g., C/C++) within mainstream IT efforts in
        recent decades. Functional programming has been successfully leveraged in specialized fields for many years--for example,
        in academia, science and engineering, financial calculation engines, artificial intelligence and development tools.

    desc : |-4
        **Fuzzy logic** is a reasoning paradigm that deals with approximate or imprecise information by enabling variables to be
        described (often linguistically) and acted upon in terms of their degree of membership in predetermined sets. Control
        systems in electronic equipment and consumer products and other embedded control systems are among the most popular
        applications.
