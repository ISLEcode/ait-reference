    desc : |-4
        **Data center storage encryption** tools offer configuration, management and reporting for disparate encryption solutions
        that are available for encrypting data in enterprise data centers. The console manages the encryption infrastructure (key
        management, policy definition, enforcement and access control), and deploys policies and configurations to the component
        that performs the actual encryption. Key management is handled by the encryption tools or by an enterprise key manager,
        and data access is managed at the application or data storage layer.

    term : Data Center
    abbr :
    from : ITIL glossary (2013)
    desc : |-4
        The **data center** is the department in an enterprise that houses and maintains back-end information technology (IT)
        systems and data stores--its mainframes, servers and databases. In the days of large, centralized IT operations, this
        department and all the systems resided in one physical place, hence the name data center.

        With today's more distributed computing methods, single data center sites are still common, but are becoming less so. The
        term continues to be used to refer to the department that has responsibility for these systems, no matter how dispersed
        they are.

        Market and industry trends are changing the way enterprises approach their data center strategies. Several factors are
        driving enterprises to look beyond traditional technology infrastructure silos and transform the way they view their data
        center environment and business processes. These include aging data center infrastructures that are at risk for not
        meeting future business requirements, an ongoing cost-consciousness, and the need to be more energy-efficient.

        Many enterprises are looking to virtualization, fabric-based infrastructure, modular designs and cloud computing as they
        explore how best to optimize their resources.

    term : Data Deduplication
    abbr :
    from : ITIL glossary (2013)
    desc : |-4
        **Data deduplication** is a form of compression that eliminates redundant data on a subfile level, improving storage
        utilization. In this process, only one copy of the data is stored; all the redundant data will be eliminated, leaving only
        a pointer to the previous copy of the data. Deduplication can significantly reduce the required disk space, since only the
        unique data is stored.

    term : Data Dependency Mapping
    abbr :
    from : ITIL glossary (2013)
    desc : |-4
        **Data dependency mapping** products are software products that determine and report on the likelihood of achieving
        specified recovery targets, based on analyzing and correlating data from applications, databases, clusters, OSs, virtual
        systems, networking and storage replication mechanisms. These products operate on direct-attached storage (DAS),
        storage-area-network (SAN)-connected storage and network-attached storage (NAS) at the primary production and secondary
        recovery data centers.

    term : Data Integration
    abbr :
    from : ITIL glossary (2013)
    desc : |-4
        The discipline of **data integration** comprises the practices, architectural techniques and tools for achieving the
        consistent access and delivery of data across the spectrum of data subject areas and data structure types in the
        enterprise to meet the data consumption requirements of all applications and business processes.

        Data integration tools have traditionally been delivered via a set of related markets, with vendors in each market
        offering a specific style of data integration tool. In recent years, most of the activity has been within the ETL tool
        market. Markets for replication tools, data federation (EII) and other submarkets each included vendors offering tools
        optimized for a particular style of data integration, and periphery markets (such as data quality tools, adapters and data
        modeling tools) also overlapped with the data integration tool space. The result of all this historical fragmentation in
        the markets is the equally fragmented and complex way in which data integration is accomplished in large enterprises --
        different teams using different tools, with little consistency, lots of overlap and redundancy, and no common management
        or leverage of metadata. Technology buyers have been forced to acquire a portfolio of tools from multiple vendors to amass
        the capabilities necessary to address the full range of their data integration requirements.

        This situation is now changing, with the separate and distinct data integration tool submarkets converging at the vendor
        and technology levels. This is being driven by buyer demands as organizations realize they need to think about data
        integration holistically and have a common set of data integration capabilities they can use across the enterprise. It is
        also being driven by the actions of vendors, such as those in individual data integration submarkets organically expanding
        their capabilities into neighboring areas, as well as by acquisition activity that brings vendors from multiple submarkets
        together. The result is a market for complete data integration tools that address a range of different data integration
        styles and are based on common design tooling, metadata and runtime architecture.

        **Data loss protection (DLP)** describes a set of technologies and inspection techniques used to classify information
        content contained within an object -- such as a file, email, packet, application or data store -- while at rest (in
        storage), in use (during an operation) or in transit (across a network). DLP tools are also have the ability to
        dynamically apply a policy -- such as log, report, classify, relocate, tag and encrypt -- and/or apply enterprise data
        rights management protections.

        **Data profiling** is a technology for discovering and investigating data quality issues, such as duplication, lack of
        consistency, and lack of accuracy and completeness. This is accomplished by analyzing one or multiple data sources and
        collecting metadata that shows the condition of the data and enables the data steward to investigate the origin of data
        errors. The tools provide data statistics, such as degree of duplication and ratios of attribute values, both in tabular
        and graphical formats.

        **Data quality software as a service (SaaS)** refers to data quality functionality (such as profiling, matching,
        standardization and validation) delivered using a model in which an external provider owns the infrastructure and provides
        the capabilities in a shared, multitenant environment used by its customers. Various offerings for data quality SaaS can
        be used as alternatives to in-house deployments of data quality software tools or the development of custom-coded
        solutions.

    term : Data Quality Tools
    abbr :
    from : ITIL glossary (2013)
    desc : |-4
        The market for data quality tools has become highly visible in recent years as more organizations understand the impact of
        poor-quality data and seek solutions for improvement. Traditionally aligned with cleansing of customer data (names and
        addresses) in support of CRM-related activities, the tools have expanded well beyond such capabilities, and
        forward-thinking organizations are recognizing the relevance of these tools in other data domains. Product data -- often
        driven by MDM initiatives -- and financial data (driven by compliance pressures) are two such areas in which demand for
        the tools is quickly building.

        Data quality tools are used to address various aspects of the data quality problem:

        -   Parsing and standardization -- Decomposition of text fields into component parts and formatting of values into
            consistent layouts based on industry standards, local standards (for example, postal authority standards for address
            data), user-defined business rules, and knowledge bases of values and patterns

        -   Generalized "cleansing" -- Modification of data values to meet domain restrictions, integrity constraints or other
            business rules that define sufficient data quality for the organization

        -   Matching -- Identification, linking or merging related entries within or across sets of data

        -   Profiling -- Analysis of data to capture statistics (metadata) that provide insight into the quality of the data and
            aid in the identification of data quality issues

        -   Monitoring -- Deployment of controls to ensure ongoing conformance of data to business rules that define data quality
            for the organization

        -   Enrichment -- Enhancing the value of internally held data by appending related attributes from external sources (for
            example, consumer demographic attributes or geographic descriptors)

        The tools provided by vendors in this market are generally consumed by technology users for internal deployment in their
        IT infrastructure, although hosted data quality solutions are continuing to emerge and grow in popularity. The tools are
        increasingly implemented in support of general data quality improvement initiatives, as well as within critical
        applications, such as ERP, CRM and BI. As data quality becomes increasingly pervasive, many data integration tools now
        include data quality management functionality.

        The **data scientist** role is critical for organizations looking to extract insight from information assets for "big
        data" initiatives and requires a broad combination of skills that may be fulfilled better as a team, for example:
        Collaboration and team work is required for working with business stakeholders to understand business issues. Analytical
        and decision modeling skills are required for discovering relationships within data and detecting patterns. Data
        management skills are required to build the relevant dataset used for the analysis.

        A form of embedded middleware that allows applications to update data on two systems so that the data sets are identical.
        These services can run via a variety of different transports but typically require some application-specific knowledge of
        the context and notion of the data being synchronized.

    term : Data Warehouse
    abbr :
    from : ITIL glossary (2013)
    desc : |-4
        A **data warehouse** is a storage architecture designed to hold data extracted from transaction systems, operational data
        stores and external sources. The warehouse then combines that data in an aggregate, summary form suitable for
        enterprise-wide data analysis and reporting for predefined business needs. The five components of a data warehouse are
        production data sources, data extraction and conversion, the data warehouse database management system, data warehouse
        administration and business intelligence (BI) tools.

        A data warehouse contains data arranged into abstracted subject areas with time-variant versions of the same records, with
        an appropriate level of data grain or detail to make it useful across two or more different types of analyses most often
        deployed with tendencies to third normal form. A data mart contains similarly time-variant and subject-oriented data, but
        with relationships implying dimensional use of data wherein facts are distinctly separate from dimension data, thus making
        them more appropriate for single categories of analysis.

        **Demand pattern analysis** is an emerging area in supply chain management (SCM) that analyzes customer and demand data to
        better predict demand across multiple time horizons in a demand-driven value network (DDVN). For example, in the strategic
        time horizon (12 months to three years), companies can analyze macro changes in customer demand, macroeconomic indicators
        and corporate strategic business goals, such as reaching a target market share for an established product. Tactically (12
        weeks to 12 months), companies can better analyze demand with increased collaboration with customers on marketing plans,
        including more alignment for new product introduction (NPI), seasonality or a promotional event. Operationally (one week
        to 12 weeks), companies can leverage frameworks like collaborative planning, forecasting and replenishment (CPFR) and
        causal forecasting, as opposed to relying on lagging historical demand data to determine downstream needs and
        opportunities.

        A Gartner term describing the combination of XML and Internet transport protocols -- such as HTTP, SMTP and FTP -- to
        create a ubiquitous capability to exchange structured information. The metaphor relies on the contrast between previous
        business to business (B2B) message exchanges -- such as electronic data exchange (EDI) using X12, EDI for Administration,
        Commerce and Transportation (EDIFACT) and various vertical-industry-specific standards -- and the unstructured
        communications media of telephone and fax. The former required considerable investment and the interposition of a private
        network -- or substantial bilateral negotiation -- to achieve interoperability, while the latter are ubiquitous and
        broadly interoperable. With the Internet and ubiquitous software to implement Internet transport protocols, business
        partners can reduce the cost, delay and risk of implementing B2B messaging.

        Internet transport protocols by themselves do not constitute a complete digital-dial-tone solution. For secure application
        messaging to occur over the Internet, communicating systems must be programmed to additional specifications in key areas
        such as security, routing and access control. Ubiquity will not be achieved until integration products agree on standards
        for meeting these requirements.

        **Distributed generation (DG)** is a supply technology that can be at or near retail load, enabling smart buildings and
        power park/premium operating districts, providing high-quality, 99.999% reliability. Combined with on-site energy storage,
        DG is a disruptive technology transforming centrally managed radial delivery infrastructure into a geodesic network,
        providing higher resilience of the power system and enabling consumer integration into energy markets. Traditionally more
        associated with high-availability fuel cells, increasingly renewable solutions, most notably photovoltaic (PV) solar, are
        being included as part of a DG solution.

        **Document management (DM)** is a function in which applications or middleware perform data management tasks tailored for
        typical unstructured documents (including compound documents). It may also be used to manage the flow of documents through
        their life cycles.

        Long-established document management products have traditionally focused on managing a small group of documents vital to
        the business. However, the DM market is transforming into a two-tier market, with new competitors building out horizontal
        capabilities to manage the many documents created in the course of everyday work life.

        Today, enterprises are looking for ways to cut costs, reduce risk, and enable competitive opportunities, resulting in new
        market opportunities and competitive forces. Vendors are scrambling to compete by leveraging their existing market
        positions as well as experimenting with new approaches such as open source and software as a service (SaaS).
