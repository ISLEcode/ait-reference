        A **labor management system** provides labor productivity reporting and planning capabilities. The planning capabilities
        provide the ability to analyze workforce requirements given a certain amount of work to be performed and a standard unit
        of time to perform each element of work. Labor productivity planning capabilities provide the ability to measure and
        report the performance of individuals, groups or facilities vs. a predefined standard for performing each defined element
        of work.

    term : LAN (local-area Network)
    abbr :
    from : ITIL glossary (2013)
    desc : |-4
        A geographically limited communication network that connects users within a defined area. A LAN is generally contained
        within a building or small group of buildings and is managed and owned by a single enterprise. The shorter distances
        within a building or campus enable faster communications at a lower cost than wide-area networks (WANs). Although an
        increasing number of LANs use Internet standards and protocols, they are normally protected from the public Internet by
        firewalls.

        LANs are generally used to perform the following functions:

        Send output to printers attached to the network.

        Transfer data or software to or from other systems attached to the network.

        Send e-mail to other users on the network.

        Access wider-area networks, including the Internet, via a direct connection from the network, for external file transfer,
        e-mail, facsimile, group collaboration and videoconferencing.

    desc : |-4
        A device that emits a highly coherent beam of light. The term stands for "light amplification by stimulated emission of
        radiation." A typical laser has an active medium, which emits light, and a cavity structure, which selects certain
        wavelengths and directions for the emitted light. Lasers convert electrical energy into radiant energy in the visible or
        infrared parts of the spectrum, emitting light with a small spectral bandwidth. For this reason, they are widely used in
        fiber-optic communications, particularly as sources for long-haul links.

        Lead-acid batteries are a mainstay of power backup systems in data centers, as well as many other applications where high
        capacity and rechargeability are required. Although they have been incrementally improved over time, these batteries have
        several drawbacks: They're highly corrosive, they have limited economic life, they're heavy and they require substantial
        space. Given that **lithium batteries** are being rapidly developed for electric and hybrid vehicles, they may have
        applicability for data centers, if their high cost can be substantially reduced. (Lithium batteries are about five times
        more expensive than lead-acid batteries for the same power capacity.)Lithium batteries' principal benefits are that they
        are about one-quarter the weight and take up about one-half the space of lead-acid equivalents. However, if their costs
        can't be substantially lowered, they will have limited data center application.

        A **local positioning system (LPS)**  is technology used to pinpoint indoor position, similar to the global positioning
        system (GPS) used to locate outdoor position. LPS triangulates signals from cell controllers to proprietary long-range,
        long-life, low-cost radio frequency electronic tags. By calculating the distance between cell controllers, electronic tags
        and several different antennae, equipment or personnel inside an enterprise can be instantly located.

        **Low-cost domestic (LCD) service delivery** is the delivery of IT service resources in domestic locations (either
        "onsite" at the buyer's premises or "onshore" at a location beyond the buyer's premises but in the same country). LCD
        locations could include smaller metropolitan locations, economically challenged metropolitan locations or rural areas
        where salaries and operating costs are typically lower.  In the U.S. market, localization of LCD terms has evolved in the
        press/media (for example, "rural sourcing," "ruralshoring," "farmshoring" and "homeshoring" are also a subset of
        onshoring).

        **Long Term Evolution Advanced (LTE-A)** is defined in 3GPP Release 10 and is intended to be the first fully compliant
        version of the ITU's specification for 4G systems. The targeted peak rate for downlink is 1 Gbps and, for uplink, greater
        than 500 Mbps. This should be achieved with scalable usage of up to 100 MHz spectrum. LTE-A should support various cell
        types, including pico and femto, to improve uplink speeds as well as relay technologies to improve coverage. Furthermore,
        LTE-A should be backward compatible to LTE, Release 8.
