    desc : "Greek philosopher and polymath during the Classical period in Ancient Greece. Taught by Plato, he was the founder of

           psychology, linguistics, economics, politics, and government. Aristotle provided a complex synthesis of the various
           philosophies existing prior to him. It was above all from his teachings that the West inherited its intellectual
           lexicon, as well as problems and methods of inquiry. As a result, his philosophy has exerted a unique influence on
           almost every form of knowledge in the West and it continues to be a subject of contemporary philosophical discussion."
