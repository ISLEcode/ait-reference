           outrageous fortune, | Or to take arms against a sea of troubles, | And by opposing end them? To die: to sleep: | No
           more; and by a sleep to say we end | The heartache and the thousand natural shocks | That flesh is heir to,--'t is a
           consummation | Devoutly to be wish'd. To die, to sleep; | To sleep: perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub: | For in
           that sleep of death what dreams may come, | When we have shuffled off this mortal coil, | Must give us pause: there's
           the respect | That makes calamity of so long life; | For who would bear the whips and scorns of time, | The
           oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely, | The pangs of despised love, the law's delay, | The insolence of office
           and the spurns | That patient merit of the unworthy takes, | When he himself might his quietus make | With a bare

           death, | The undiscover'd country from whose bourn | No traveller returns, puzzles the will | And makes us rather bear
           those ills we have | Than fly to others that we know not of? | Thus conscience does make cowards of us all; | And thus
           the native hue of resolution | Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought, | And enterprises of great pith and
           moment | With this regard their currents turn awry, | And lose the name of action."

           must look to themselves first. It's our duty to look after ourselves and then, also to look after our neighbour.
