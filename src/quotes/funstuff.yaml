        -   The Buddhist says don't worry, remember the glass is already broken.

        -   The logician says that where the glass is in process of being filled then it is half full; where it is in the process
            of being emptied then it is half empty; and where its status in terms of being filled or emptied is unknown then the
            glass is one in which a boundary between liquid and gas lies exactly midway between the inside bottom and the upper
            rim, assuming that the glass has parallel sides and rests on a level surface, and where it does not then the

            original content back in; if the combined content overflows the lip, the glass was more than half full; if it doesn't
            reach the top, the glass was more than half empty; if it neither overflows nor fails to reach the top then it was
            either half-full or half-empty. Now what was the question again?

        -   The Dutchman would suggest to both pay for the glass and share the content. Then tells you he will have the bottom
            half.

        -   The personal coach knows that the glass goes from full to empty depending on the circumstances, and reminds the
            drinker that he can always fill the glass when he wishes.

        -   The grammarian says that while the terms half-full and half-empty are colloquially acceptable the glass can
            technically be neither since both full and empty are absolute states and therefore are incapable of being halved or
            modified in any way.

        -   The auditor first checks whether the empty half is material and then designs the audit procedures to obtain
            sufficient evidence to conclude that the glass is indeed empty.

        -   The waiter will hurry to replace it with a full one. For him there are no doubts: the glass was empty when he took it
            away; it is full in the bill that he brings you.

        -   The magician will show you the glass with the full half at the top.

        -   The physician says that the glass is not empty at all - it is half-filled with water and half-filled with air - hence,

  - name : Softly softly catchee monkey
    quot : |-4

        The saying "Softly softly, catchee monkey," (alternatively "Softly softly, catchee monkee") refers to situations where
        achieving success requires a patient, careful and quiet strategy.

        The phrase is [pidgin English](clichesorigins.htm#pidgin_English_pigeon_English) from the late 1800s or earlier, either a
        genuine part of language among native people of a developing region, or a phrase used in pidgin style by British people
        working overseas. Sources such as Partridge and Rees indicate that the saying originated in Africa or elsewhere among
        black people. Logically it would also have to have been in a part of the world where monkeys were hunted. You might see
        references to Lord Baden-Powell (1857-1941), founder of the Boy Scout movement and a military leader in Africa and India,
        having used the phrase, but he did not coin it, if indeed he actually used it.

        The saying is now used in shortened form "Softly softly," meaning the same as the full version, popularised mainly by the
        1960s UK TV crime detective series of that name, which apparently (Rees says) was inspired by the 'Softly Softly' motto of
        the Lancashire Constabulary Training School.

        For an amusing comparison and similar analogy about planning and implementing tasks which require care and patience, see

  - name : funny paternity explanations (allegedly) from Child Support Agency (CSA) forms
    quot : |-4

        These comments (allegedly) were provided by mothers on CSA forms in response to the CSA request for details of children's
        fathers. Aside from being variously amusing and sad in their own right some of these quotes illustrate the admirable
        spirit and humour that people can exhibit in the face of personal challenge, institutional bureaucracy and what some
        clearly regard as an invasion of privacy.

          > I don't know the identity of the father of my daughter. He drives a BMW that now has a hole made by my stiletto in
          > one of the door panels. Perhaps you can contact the BMW dealers in the area to see if he's had it replaced.

          > I have never had sex with a man. I am waiting for a letter from the Pope confirming that my son's conception was

          > discovering he is gay I am not so sure

          > Regarding the identity of the father of my twins, child A was fathered by XYZ. I am unsure about child B but I
          > believe he was conceived on the same night

          > I remember buying the sperm at a boot market last spring but I never kept the documentation I'm afraid

          > I cannot tell you the name of child A's father as he informs me that to do so would blow his cover, and that this
          > would have cataclysmic implications for the British economy. I am torn between doing right by you and right by my
          > country. Please advise

          > From the dates it seems my daughter was conceived at EuroDisney. Maybe it really is the Magic Kingdom

          > That night is a blur. The only thing I remember was watching a Delia Smith programme about eggs in the evening. If I

          > He gave me a phone number which turned out to be one of his mates who said he'd been killed in a cement mixer

  - name : Smile (Charlie Chaplin story)
    quot : |-4

        The words to the song 'Smile' are one of the great anthems for personal inspiration and belief. The music for Smile was
        written by Charlie Chaplin for his landmark film, Modern Times, released in 1936, although Smile's lyrics were actually
        added by John Turner and Geoffrey Parsons in 1954, in which year Nat King Cole had the commercial success with the Smile
        song. Perhaps understandably the owners of the copyright for the words and music of the Smile song, Bourne Company of New
        York, refused me permission to publish the full lyrics and the music, although plenty of other websites seem to have the
        whole thing for free if you care to look for it (strangely it seems easier to get it for free than to buy it). There is
        actually a second verse which talks about lighting up your face with gladness, the need to keep on trying, and that life
        is still worthwhile. And for the musicians among you, you could try playing around with A, Amaj7, F\#m, D/F\#bass, Bm,
        F\#, Bm, Dm, A, F\#m, Bm, Esus4, E, and A, which is based on an interpretation by Eric Clapton (another story of triumph
        over adversity).

        | Smile tho' your heart is aching,
        | Smile even tho' it's breaking,
        | When there are clouds in the sky, you'll get by.
        | If you smile thro' your fear and sorrow,
        | Smile and maybe tomorrow,
        | You'll see the sun come shining through; for you.

        Although Charlie Chaplin didn't write the lyrics to Smile, the words resonate strongly with Chaplin's inspirational life
        of challenge, tragedy, success, and ultimately global appreciation, which owed much to his difficult early
        character-forming years. The Smile lyrics, and Chaplin's life story, each provide in their own way a lesson for anyone
        seeking inspiration and personal fulfilment.

        Chaplin was born in Walworth, South London on 16 April, 1889. His mother and father were stage performers, but were also
        tragic people, divorcing when Charlie was young. As a child Chaplin descended to the workhouse orphanage because his
        parents were unable to look after him. Throughout his life Charlie Chaplin struggled with challenges, some of his own
        making, while he strived and became one of the most successful achievers - in creative and financial terms - of the 20th
        century. At one time exiled and rejected by the USA for his political views, Chaplin was awarded the World Peace Prize in
        1954, eventually welcomed back to America to receive an Academy Lifetime Achievement Award in 1972, and was knighted in
        1975. Charlie Chaplin died on Christmas Day, 1977.

        The words and music of Smile and Chaplin's wonderful films help to demonstrate that the power of personal belief, and a
        positive approach to life, can enable people to overcome all kinds of disadvantage, challenge and adversity.

  - name : The five stages of innovation
    quot : |-4

        1.  People deny that the innovation is required.
        2.  People deny that the innovation is effective.
        3.  People deny that the innovation is important.
        4.  People deny that the innovation will justify the effort required to adopt it.
        5.  People accept and adopt the innovation, enjoy its benefits, attribute it to people other than the innovator, and deny
            the existence of stages 1 to 4.

        Inspired by Alexander von Humboldt's 'Three Stages Of Scientific Discovery', as referenced by Bill Bryson in his book, 'A
        Short History Of Nearly Everything'.

        Not applicable of course to courageous early adopters of innovation everywhere.

        Early adoption of innovation might not be natural to everyone - but it is an option worth considering, especially if you
        have a feeling that the present situation can be improved.

  - name : Ambrose bierce quotes - the devil's dictionary
    quot : |-4

        The Devil's Dictionary was written by American Ambrose Bierce around a hundred years ago, and was first published as 'The
        Cynic's Word Book' in 1906. It was reissued as 'The Devil's Dictionary' in 1911, and continues to be published today. Its
        humour and irony still shine. In fact many of its observations perhaps resonate more strongly now than when Bierce first
        made them. Here are some choice examples of Bierce's wit, and interestingly for a writer considered to be such a 'cynic',
        these quotes are also examples of a touching sensitivity. These quotes still serve, as when they were created, to remind
        us that whether a thing is a force for good or bad is largely decided by the human factor. This is an encouraging thought,
        since the implication of this is that we have it in our power to change bad into good. I think Bierce would have agreed.

        Corporation: An ingenious device for obtaining individual profit without individual responsibility. (If you work for one
        of these be assured that there are more ethical and caring employers out there who would be more deserving of your efforts
        and loyalty.)

        Duty: That which sternly impels us in the direction of profit, along the line of desire.

        Experience: The wisdom that enables us to recognize as an undesirable old acquaintance the folly that we have already
        embraced.

        Famous: Conspicuously miserable.

        Land: A part of the Earth's surface, considered as property.The theory that land is property subject to private ownership
        and control is the foundation of modern society. Carried to its logical conclusion, it means that some have the right to
        prevent others from living. It follows that if the whole aea of terra firma (Earth) is owned by A, B and C, then there
        will be no place for D, E, F and G to be born, or, born as trespassers, to exist. (How true, and how applicable today.)

        Lecturer: One with his hand in your pocket, his tongue in your ear, and his faith in your patience.

        Marriage: The state or condition of a community consisting of a master, a mistress and two slaves, making in all, two.

        Overeat: To dine.

        Pain: An uncomfortable frame of mind that may have a physical basis in something that is being done to the body, or may be
        purely mental, caused by the good fortune of another.

        Peace: In international affairs, a period of cheating between two periods of fighting.

    quot : |-4

        The pun (a humourous device exploiting two words or expressions sounding the same with two different meanings, usually
        with two different spellings) is one of the great wonders of the English language. For anyone who seeks to demonstrate
        the confusing nature of English words and phrases, these examples of funny and clever puns will likely serve your needs.

          - See one melée of unruly people and you've seen a maul.
          - Do hungry time-travellers ever go back four seconds?

        (The 'fruit flies like a banana' quote is attributed by some to Groucho Marx, although firm evidence has yet to support
        this - thanks I Phipps. I can remember this from the 1970s. I suspect it is older, whether it was one of Groucho Marx's or
        not. If anyone has any suggestions of origin for this one in particular please let me know.)

  - name : Tribal wisdom ('dead horse strategies' - updated for the 21st century)
    quot : |-4

        There seem to be various versions of this. This is a newer angle.

        According to legend and the customary presentation of this item, the tribal wisdom of the Dakota Indians, presumably
        passed on from generation to generation (bear with me please), says that, "When you discover that you are riding a dead
        horse, the best strategy is to dismount."

        However, in government, education and the corporate world, more advanced strategies are often employed, such as (and
        updated here for the 21st century):

        1.  Giving dead horse and rider a good bollocking (a favourite in previous centuries too).
        2.  Re-structuring the dead horse's reward scale to contain a performance-related element (obviously)
        3.  Suspending the horse's access to the executive grassy meadow until it improves its attitude and makes good all
            productivity shortfalls.
        4.  Finding a mentor or buddy for the dead horse.
        5.  Examining the cost-savings accruing from de-skilling the dead horse function.
        6.  Denying the existence of the dead horse, until the story appears in the Drudge Report, upon which release ready-made
            PR featuring the dead horse 'in action', thus totally fooling everyone who thought the horse was dead (but it still is
            of course).
        7.  Re-aligning the organizational aims to better fit the needs of the dead horse.
        8.  Outsourcing the management and/or the riding of the dead horse to a specialist dead horse management company (another
            firm favourite that won't go away).
        9.  Bringing in a team of expensive external consultants to focus on dead horse optimisation.
        10. Re-branding the dead horse a 'Fair Trade Horse', and affixing prominent Fair Trade insignia to its hind-quarters.
        11. Scrutinsing and challenging the dead horse's expenses claims, and leaking baseless related accusations to the media
            and the dead horse transparency unit.
        12. Asking Richard Branson if he'd be interested in running a Virgin Dead Horse joint venture.
        13. Setting up a free-phone customer service hotline to handle complaints relating to the dead horse fiasco.
        14. Re-designing the dead horse's shoes so that they can be made of bamboo and re-cycled.
        15. Setting up an inquiry into the dead horse, preferably headed by a dead horse and answerable to other dead horses.
        16. Forming a task force to investigate the dead horse's positive benefits on social enterprise.
        17. Blaming the dead horse on the sub-prime credit crunch, thereby absolving (and enabling the obscenely generous
            rewarding of) those responsible for the decision to recruit an emaciated horse, starve it, and keep it in a frozen
            field (because the stables were sold to property developers years ago).
        18. Unmasking the dead horse to be in illegal immigrant, therefore author of its own misfortune, and to blame for a lot
            more than simply being dead on the job.
        19. Appointing a top advertising agency to promote the benefits of the reduced carbon hoofprint of a dead horse compared
            to the ridiculously out-dated and unsustainable notion of a living horse.
        20. Off-shoring the stabling and veterinary support of the dead horse to somewhere in the Indian sub-continent.
        21. Sending the dead horse on an outward bound or log-carrying weekend with other dead horses.
        22. Lobbying ministers and pressure groups for the extension of European standards to encompass the special qualities of
            dead horses.
        23. Nationalising the dead horse.
        24. Making the dead horse redundant, giving it a hefty golden hoof-shake, and then retaining it as consultant at five
            times its previous annual cost.

        Adapted from various versions. Other suggested strategies are very welcome and will be added to the list if they are
        suitably original. I'm sure you have much better ideas than these.

        Since first publishing this item (initially in a more traditional format) I have been pointed towards (thanks J Towers and

        Business Strategy (ASQ Press 2003) Appendix F, Strategic Wisdom (actually Strategic "Wisdom"). Bill Dettmer's introduction
        to the 'Dead Horse Strategies' indicates that he did not devise the concept, and that it had existed for 'a period of
        years' (prior to 2003). If you know where the 'Dead Horse Strategies' or 'Dakota Tribal Wisdom' came from, or you know of

        productively is [Erikson's Life-Stage Theory](erik_erikson_psychosocial_theory.htm). )

        On pain and stress and approach to life: "Pain is a relatively objective, physical phenomenon; suffering is our
        psychological resistance to what happens. Events may create physical pain, but they do not in themselves create suffering.
        Resistance creates suffering. Stress happens when your mind resists what is. The only problem in your life is your
        mind's resistance to life as it unfolds." (Dan Millman, 21st century philosopher from The Way of the Peaceful Warrior -
        ack CB)

        On Knowledge - "If you stood on the bottom rail of a bridge, and leant over, and watched the river slipping slowly away
        beneath you, you would suddenly know everything that there is to be known." (Winnie the Pooh - allegedly - Thanks CM)

        "He trudged along unknowing what he sought, And whistled as he went, for want of thought." (John Dryden, English poet and
        playwright 1631-1700, from Cymon and Iphigenia written in 1700)

        "Men fear thought as they fear nothing else on earth - more than ruin - more even than death Thought is subversive and
        revolutionary, destructive and terrible, thought is merciless to privilege, established institutions, and comfortable
        habit. Thought looks into the pit of hell and is not afraid. Thought is great and swift and free, the light of the world,
        and the chief glory of man." (Bertrand Russell, British philosopher, 1872-1970)

        "Great men are they who see that spiritual thought is stronger than any material force, that thoughts rule the world."
        (Ralph Waldo Emerson, American philosopher and poet, 1803-82, from Progress of Culture)

        "For as he thinketh in his heart, so is he." (The Holy Bible, Proverbs 23:7)

        "What is life but the angle of vision? A man is measured by the angle at which he looks at objects. What is life but what
        a man is thinking of all day? This is his fate and his employer. Knowing is the measure of the man. By how much we know,
        so we are." (Ralph Waldo Emerson)

        "The mind is the man, and knowledge mind; a man is but what he knoweth." (Francis Bacon, English lawyer and philosopher,
        1561-1626)

  - name : Karen Walker quotes
    quot : |-4

        Irony is a powerful way to emphasise a point, and these quotes cover a wide range of subjects, aside from which they are
        all useful in illustrating extremes of attitude, bigotry and insecurity.

        An ironic representation of heartlessness, the comedy character Karen Walker was played by Megan Mullally in TV's Will &
        Grace. The award-winning series was created by David Kohan and Max Mutchnick, and 29 writers were involved in the 186
        episodes running from 1998-2006, which makes it a little difficult to attribute precisely these wonderful ironic quotes.

        "It's not something you can just run away from like a hotel bill or a crying baby."

        "It's a victimless crime, like tax evasion or public indecency."

        (To a waiter) "Hey apron - who told you you could make eye contact?."

        "Husbands come and go but the Chanel slingback is forever."

        "It's Christmas, for goodness sake. Think about the baby Jesus. up in that tower, letting his hair down. so that the
        three wise men can climb up and spin the dradel and see if there are six more weeks of winter."

        "Oh honey, that's just a saying, like 'Ooh. That sounds like fun.' or 'I love you'."

        "It's a cult, like the Moonies, or the homeless."

        "I know what guilt is. It's one of those touchy-feely words that people throw around that don't really mean anything.
        You know, like 'maternal' or 'addiction' ."

        "You know what else is sad? Poor people who have dreams."

        "Oh yeah, honey, we're all lesbians when the right man isn't around."

            uncertainty as to how specifically he presented the FedEx model, and precisely how the examiner expressed his
            indifference. It's a good story nevertheless, and helps confirm not only that great oaks grow from tiny acorns, but
            also how difficult it is to recognize a particularly good acorn before it's grown.

  - name : This be the verse (1974) by philip larkin, english poet (1922-85)
    quot : |-4

        Larkin's words are a bitterly incisive comment on the negative effect that parents can have on their children. The words
        are especially relevant to understanding the potency of parental conditioning upon young children, notably in the context
        of [Transational Analysis](transactionalanalysis.htm).

        | They fuck you up, your Mum and Dad,

  - name : Hell hath no fury.
    quot : |-4

        | Heaven has no rage like love to hatred turned,
        | Nor Hell a fury like a woman scorned.
        |
        | The Mourning Bride, Act III, Scene viii
        | By William Congreve, 1670-1729, an English dramatist and poet

        The quotation is also useful in discussions about revenge and retaliation, tit-for-tat, negotiation and business styles, game-playing, war and diplomacy, and the fine line between positive and negative relationships. Congreve's words focus on the female view, but the principle - especially the first line - is central to the behaviour of many people.

        Sources: Bartlett's Familiar Quotations, and Chambers Biographical Dictionary.

        Incidentally (thanks M Beddingfield and A Beddingfield, Nov 2008), the word fury is derived from Greek mythology. The
        furies were Alecto, Megaera and Tisiphone, daughters of Nyx or Hades and Persephone, typically described as 'snakey haired
        women' with dogs' heads and bats' wings. According to myth the furies descended on wrong-doers (especially anyone
        disrepectful to the gods) to deliver various mental harrassment and appalling physical punishment. Chaucer is the earliest
        recorded user of the words furious and furie (rage) in English, in the late 1300s, referring to the Greek story of the
        furies, and in more general reference to rage, in which his usage stems from the Latin word furia (violent rage). The word
        fury itself therefore has very old connections with the notions of hell and female revenge, and this word history helps
        explain how the expression evolved, and was associated with ancient story-telling and beliefs

                                                    just four and five months (1914-1918). We cannot imagine this today.

          Interbellum generation        1900-1913   Interbellum means 'between wars', referring to the fact that these people
                                                    were too young to fight in the First World War and too old to fight in the
                                                    Second.

          Greatest generation           1914-1930   These people are revered for having grown up during the Great Depression and
          (The veterans)                            then fought or stood alongside those who fought in the Second World War
                                                    (1939-45). As for other generations of the early 1900s, life was truly hard
                                                    compared to later times.

          Silent generation             1930-1945   Characterized as fatalistic, accepting, having modest career and family
                                                    aspirations, focused on security and safety. These people experienced the
                                                    1930s Great Depression and/or the 2nd World War in early life, and post-war
                                                    austerity in young adulthood. They parented and provided a foundation for the
                                                    easier lives of the Baby Boomers.

          Baby Boomers                  1946-1960   Equality, freedom, civil rights, environmental concern, peace, optimism,
                                                    challenge to authority, protest. Baby Boomers mostly lived safe from war and
                                                    serious hardship; grew up mostly in families, and enjoyed economic prosperity
                                                    more often than not. Teenage/young adulthood years 1960-1980 - fashion and
                                                    music: fun, happy, cheery, sexy, colourful, lively

          Generation Jones              1953-1968   Acquisitive, ambitious, achievement-oriented, cynical, materialistic (a
                                                    reference to the expression 'keeping up with the Joneses'). Generation Jones
                                                    is predominantly a US concept, overlapping and representing a sub-group
                                                    within the Baby Boomer and Gen-X generations.

          Generation X (Gen-X)          1960-1980   Apathy, anarchy, reactionism, detachment, technophile, resentful, nomadic,
                                                    struggling. Teenage/young adulthood years 1973-2000 - fashion and music:
                                                    anarchic, bold, anti-establishment.

          MTV Generation                1974-1983   MTV Generation is a lesser-used term for a group overlapping X and Y. Like
                                                    Generation Jones is to Baby Boomers and Gen-X, so MTV Generation is a bridge
                                                    between Gen-X and Y.

          Generation Y                  1980-2000   Views vary as to when this range ends, basically because no-one knows.
          (Gen-Y, Millennials)          and beyond  Generational categories tend to become established some years after the birth
                                                    range has ended. Teenage/young adulthood years 1990s and the noughties -
                                                    fashion and music: mainstream rather than niche, swarmingly popular effects,
                                                    fuelled by social networking and referral technology.

          Generation Z                  after Gen-Y Too soon to say much about this group. A name has yet to become established,
          (Gen-Z, Generation ADD)                   let alone characterizing features. Generation Z is a logical name in the
                                                    X-Y-sequence. Generation ADD is less likely to establish itself as a name for
                                                    this cohort - it refers ironically to Attention Deficit Disorder and the
                                                    supposed inability of young people in the late noughties (say 2005-2009) to be
                                                    able to concentrate for longer than a few seconds on anything. Gen-Z is
                                                    difficult to differentiate from Gen-Y, mainly because (as at 2009) it's a
                                                    little too soon to be seeing how people born after Gen-Y are actually
                                                    behaving, unless the end of the Gen-Y range is deemed to be a few years
                                                    earlier than the year 2000. Time will tell.
