### Features and enhancements

⒈.  An awesome list of datasets to consider: <https://github.com/datasets/awesome-data>

1.  The <https://github.com/datasets> holds many datasets; many of which appear to be outdated though — i.e. not updated in many
    years. Nonetheless they remain interesting in that they hold their sources. These should be investigated as a quick win to
    collect datasets of interest; and possibly feeding data back to the project.

    As an example, they have an <https://github.com/datasets/airport-codes> which is simply a replicated (and converted) copy of
    a freely available online resource (<https://ourairports.com/data/airports.csv>). We have all necessary CSV manipulation
    tools within AIT and consequently only need to reference to master source. Source we can then source through GitHub actions.

    Below is a filtered list of datasets from this project we should further investigate. When these are old and unmaintained we
    should probably ignore them, unless the master sources are still updated and the datasets' repository isn't.
